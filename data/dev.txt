= = = Buru = = =

Between 1658 and 1942, Buru was colonised by the Dutch East India Company and then by the Crown of the Netherlands. The Japanese army had the island between 1942 and 1945. In 1950, it became part of independent Indonesia. During president Suharto's New Order administration in the 1960s–1970s, Buru was a prison for thousands of political prisoners. The famous Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer wrote most of his novels, including "Buru Quartet" in that prison.

Buru island is between two seas of the Pacific Ocean – Seram Sea () on the north and Banda Sea () to the south and west. To the east, is the Manipa Strait () then Seram Island (). The area of Buru is . Buru is the third largest Maluku Islands.
Buru is shaped like an oval. It is about from east to west and from north to south. The highest point on the island () is the peak of Mount Kapalatmada. The island is mostly mountainous, especially in the central and western parts. Much of the island is covered with tropical rain forest.

Administrative division.
The island belongs to the Indonesian province of Maluku (). It is split into Buru Regency () and South Buru Regency ().
Population.
As of the 2010 Census, the population of the islands administered as Buru was 161,828 people; at the 2015 Intermediate Census this rose to 186,779. About 68.3% in the northern regency and 31.7% in the southern;
History.
Precolonial period.
One of the first mentions of Buru is in the Nagarakretagama in 1365. That is an Old Javanese funeral speech for Hayam Wuruk, the ruler of the Majapahit Kingdom.
In the 16th–17th centuries Buru was claimed by the rulers of Ternate island and by the Portuguese. But neither nation controlled the island. They only visited it for trade. Makassar people from Sulawesi island built fortifications on Buru. The Makassars forced the locals to grow valuable spices, such as clove.
Colonial period.
The Makassars and Dutch East India Company both wanted the spices in the east of the Malay archipelago. They fought a war. In 1648, the Dutch forced the Makassar out of Buru. The Dutch destroyed farms and buildings because they could not stay on Buru and afraid that the Makassars might come back. They came back with with four cannon and staffed by 24 soldiers in 1658 at the southern coast of Kayeli Bay. They built a permanent settlement and fortress. The Dutch forced about 2,000 local island people to move to Kayeli Bay. Many of them were nobles. The Dutch wanted to control the local people and make them work in the clove fields. These local Kayeli people became important leaders.
The Dutch East India Company ended in the early 18th century. All its land in the Malay archipelago became property of the Dutch crown. Buru was divided into regencies. Local rulers called rajascontrolled the regencies for the Dutch. All rajas were Kayeli tribal nobles.
The demise of Kayeli dominance began in the 1880s, when the leaders of Leliali, Wae Sama and Fogi clans moved significant parts of their ethnic groups to their original settlements; they were joined in the early 1900s by Tagalisa. By then, many other of the original 13 Kayeli villages were either abandoned or had lost their rajas. By about 1910, the leading role of the Kayeli clan had almost disappeared.
Transition years 1942–1950.
From the spring of 1942 to the summer of 1945, the Japanese army controlled all of the Dutch East Indies, including Buru. The island was bombed by the Allies planes. They were attacking the Namlea Airport.
After Japan lost the war, control of the island went back to the Netherlands. In December 1946, Buru, along with the other Maluku Islands, Sulawesi and Lesser Sunda Islands, was included in a partly independent State of East Indonesia. It was set up by the Dutch government. They planned to let their East Indies slowly become a dependent state. In December 1949, eastern Indonesia joined the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.
In April 1950, Buru, Ambon, Seram and some smaller nearby islands started an independent Republic of South Moluccas. They promised to keep close political ties with the Netherlands. The Republic of Indonesia tried to absorb the RMS by talking. But, this failed. So, the Republic of Indonesia started a six-month war in July 1950. In December 1950, the Republic of Indonesia controlled Buru and it became part of the Republic of Indonesia.
As part of Indonesia.
Between 1950 and 1965, the new government wanted to make Buru part of Indonesia. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the military regime of General Suharto, Buru became a main prison. Most prisoners were Communists and other left-wing representatives, and intellectuals. Most camps on Buru were closed in 1980. More than 12,000 people had been prisoners. At least several hundred had died or been killed.
One of the prisoners was an Indonesian writer, Pramoedya Ananta Toer. He was in prison for 14 years (1965–1979). He wrote there many of his novels, including most of "Buru Quartet". Until 1975, Toer was not allowed pencil or paper. He memorized his novels and told them to his cellmates. They helped him to remember the stories.
Transportation.
Buru is linked with other parts of Indonesia by sea. It has two main ports in Namlea and Namrole. The military airfield at Namlea (runway 750 meters) is used for air transportation. Most local transportation is on roads.
Traditional work and culture.
Traditionally, work and culture in villages changed with seasons and people moved to follow work. and food. Men hunted wild pigs called Buru babirusa, deer, and possum. Women gathered wild vegetables. During the west monsoon (November to April) both men and women worked together in the fields. The soil on the island was not good, so sometimes villages moved to newer, better soil. Sometimes people would move their whole village after some 20 years of using one piece of land. Most settlements were small. 
Traditional Buru clothes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarongs and a long-skirted tunic. Women also wear sarongs but a shorter jacket. Color of clothes is different for the different tribes of the island.
Research.
Both Indonesian and foreign scientists study the special plant and animal life on the island. But, the original plants on the coast and much of the mountain forest have been cut or destroyed for farming. Only two large areas rain forest are still in the mountains. These are protected areas called Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km2) and Waeapo (50 km2).

PHO uses the word observatory, from astronomy, to show objectivity in measuring well-being.
Public health, environmental health, diet, recreation, outdoor education, exercise and other concerns are explored by most public health observatories.
The London Health Observatory pioneered methods in measuring social capital and how this affects healing and health in general.
There was a network of public health observatories, one in each of the nine regions in England. There are health observatories in Wales , Scotland and Ireland.
The Association of Public Health Observatories (APHO) represented the network of public health observatories across the UK and Ireland.

= = = Sentinel (sculpture) = = =
Sentinel () is a 16m high sculpture by Tim Tolkien. It is on Spitfire Island, a roundabout at the intersection of the Chester Road and the A47 Fort Parkway at the entrance to the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham.
It is near Junction 5 of the M6 motorway and the Jaguar car factory. This used to be the Castle Bromwich aircraft factory. It shows three Spitfires peeling off up into the air in different directions. The half-scale Spitfires are made of aluminium, with curving steel supporting beams which act as vapour trails. It captures the dynamics of the Spitfire in flight and commemorates the nearby Castle Bromwich factory where most of Britain's wartime Spitfires were built.
History.
The project began in 1997. The project has won awards. The project was part of the regeneration of the Castle Vale estate. It was funded by the National Lottery. Tolkien was appointed as artist in residence. He consulted local residents about an art feature. They liked the area's links to World War II aircraft. They would like a sculpture with Spitfires. The sculpture was opened on 14 November 2000. The sculptor is the great-nephew of J. R. R. Tolkien who was the author of "The Lord of the Rings," and who grew up in Birmingham.
The main commercial sponsors of the spitfire sculpture were from Jaguar, Rubery Owen Holdings and Cincinnati. Both Cincinnati and Rubery Owen Holdings made parts for the Spitfires. They were put together at the Castle Bromwich Spitfire and Avro Lancaster bomber factory. This is the factory where Jaguar cars are now made. 
The Castle Bromwich Aerodrome Factory was built in 1940 to produce planes for the war effort. About 12,000 Spitfires were made there from 1940 to 1945. Over 37,000 test flights were made from Castle Bromwich Aerodrome. The completed planes were towed across the road from the factory to the Aerodrome. The sculpture was unveiled by Alex Henshaw. He was the Chief Test Pilot for spitfires.
The aerodrome site is now the Castle Vale estate.

= = = North Sulawesi = = =
North Sulawesi () is a province of Indonesia. It is on the northeastern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi. This is called the Minahasa Peninsula. The province is south of the Philippines and southeast of Sabah, Malaysia. The Maluku Sea is to the east, the Gorontalo and Celebes Sea is to the west, and the Gulf of Tomini is to the southwest. The province's area is 13851.64 sq.km, and its population was 2,270,596 at the 2010 census;
The province's capital, business center, and largest city is Manado. Other major towns are Tomohon and Bitung. There are many tall mountains from high. The province is a young volcanic region. There are many eruptions and active volcanic cones.
In the past, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and the Kingdoms around this area fought over the riches in North Sulawesi such as spices, rice and gold. The region was also the trading route between west and east and this helped the spread of Christianity, Islam, and other religions. The Portuguese first landed in the 16th century. The Spanish and the Dutch came and the Portuguese fought them. Finally, the Dutch got control in the 17th century. The Dutch ruled the area for three centuries until the Japanese came at the start of World War II. After the Japanese lost WWII in 1945, the Dutch controlled the area again for a short time. They left in 1949. , following the Round Table Conference, in which the Dutch recognized the newly created United States of Indonesia (RIS). So, North Sulawesi became part of the territory of the State of East Indonesia (NIT). The people did not like NIT, so it became part of the Republic of Indonesia in 1950. At first, the island of Sulawesi was one single province. Soon it separated into several different provinces. So, the province of North Sulawesi started on 14 August 1959.
Name.
The area around North Sulawesi used to be called Minahasa. The name is still used sometimes. The word Minahasa comes from the words Mina-Esa (Minaesa) or Maesa which means being one or uniting This name shows hope to unite the ethnic groups of the area including the: Tontemboan, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tolour (Tondano), Tonsawang, Ponosakan, Pasan, and Bantik. The word "Minahasa" was first used by J.D. Schierstein, the Dutch regent of Manado, in his report to the Governor of Maluku on 8 October 1789.
History.
Pre-historic.
Archaeological research has revealed signs of human life in North Sulawesi since 30,000 years ago, based on evidence in the cave Liang Sarru on the island of Salibabu. Other evidence shows life about 6,000 years ago on the Passo Hillside Site in Kakas District and 4,000 years ago to early AD at the Liang Tuo Mane'e cave in Arangkaa on Karakelang Island.
Colonial Period.
At the end of the 16th century, Portuguese and Spanish arrived in North Sulawesi. The Portugal was the first western nation to arrive in North Sulawesi. A Portuguese ship landed at Manado The Sultanate of Maguindanao controlled the northern islands at that time. The Portuguese built the fort at Amurang.
The Spanish ship docked on the island of Talaud and Siau, on to Ternate. Spain built the Fort in Manado, since then Minahasa started in control of Spain. The resistance against the Spanish occupation culminated in 1660–1664.
The Dutch ship landed in Manado City in 1660 in assisting the struggle of the Minahasa Confederation against Spain. The United Nations republican association of members of the Minahasa Confederation entered into a Trade Agreement with the VOC. This trade cooperation agreement then made the VOC monopolize the trade, which gradually began to impose its will, eventually leading to the 1700s resistance in Ratahan which culminated in the Dutch Minahasa-War in 1809–1811 at Tondano.
The Spanish had already colonized the Philippine Islands. They made Minahasa a coffee plantation. Spain made Manado a center of coffee trade for Chinese merchants. Some Minahasan tribes helped Spain capture the Portuguese fort at Amurang in the 1550s. The Spanish colonists then built the fort in Manado. Finally, Spain controlled all Minahasa.
In the 16th century one of the first Indo-Eurasian communities in the archipelago was in Manado. The first king of Manado was Muntu Untu (1630). He was half Spanish ancestry. Spain later gave Minahasa to the Portuguese in exchange for 350,000 ducats in a treaty. The rulers of Minahasa sent Supit, Pa'at, and Lontoh to fight with the Dutch to force the Portuguese out of Minahasa. They succeeded in 1655. They built their own fortress in 1658 and forced out the last Portuguese a few years later.
By the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch had overthrown the sultanate of Ternate. They began to reduce the power of Spain and Portugal in the archipelago. In 1677 the Dutch conquered the Sangir archipelago. Two years later, Robert Padtbrugge, the governor of Maluku, visited Manado. He made an agreement with the Minahasan chiefs. This let the Dutch dominate for the next 300 years. However, direct rule by the Dutch only began in 1870. The Dutch helped unite the Minahasa confederation. In 1693 the Minahnians won a military victory against the Mongondow tribe in the south. Dutch influence increased and Christianity and European culture grew in Minahasa. The missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were one of the first attempts of mass education in Indonesia. Graduates of the schools could find work as civil servants, in the army, and in the Dutch East Indies government. Minahasa relations with the Dutch were often poor. There was a war between the Dutch and Tondano in 1807 and 1809. The Minahasa territory was not under Dutch direct rule until 1870. But eventually the Dutch and Minahasa became very close. So, Minahasa was often called the 12th Dutch province. Even in 1947, Manado formed the political movement of Twapro, short for Twaalfde Profincie (Twelfth Province) who wanted formal integration of Minahasa into the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
Independence.
The Japanese occupied the area from 1942 to 1945. was a period of deprivation, and the allied forces bombed Manado greatly in 1945. During the period of independence thereafter, there was a split between pro-Indonesian and pro-Dutch Minahasa. The appointment of Sam Ratulangi as the first East Indonesia governor then succeeded in winning Minahasa support to the Republic of Indonesia. After Indonesian independence, Indonesia is divided into 8 Provinces, and Sulawesi is one of these provinces. Sulawesi's first governor was S.G.J.Ratulangi, also known as a national hero. In 1948 in Sulawesi was formed the State of East Indonesia, which later became one of the states within the United States of Indonesia. The State of East Indonesia was dissolved, and merged into the Republic of Indonesia. Based on Law Number 13 Year 1964, formed North Sulawesi Province. 14 August 1959 was designated as the anniversary of the province.
In March 1957, North and South Sulawesi military leaders demanded more freedom from Java. They wanted more active development, sharing tax money fairly, and help against Kahar Muzakar's rebellion in South Sulawesi. They wanted a central government led by both Sukarno and Hatta equally. At first the movement of the 'Permesta' (Charter of the Struggle of the Universe) was merely a movement of reform rather than a separatist movement.
Negotiations between the central government and Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in South Sulawesi, but Minahasan leaders were not satisfied with the outcome of the agreement and the movement broke out. Fearful of southern dominance, Minahasan leaders declared their own North Sulawesi autonomous state in June 1957. At that time the central government had controlled South Sulawesi, but in the North there were no strong figures of the central government and there were rumors that the United States was armed with rebellion in Sumatra North, also has links with Minahasan leaders.
The possibility of foreign intervention prompted the central government to request military assistance from southern Sulawesi. The Permesta forces were later removed from Central Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Sangir, and Morotai in Maluku. Permesta planes (supplied by the US and flown by Philippine, Taiwanese, and American Pilots) were destroyed. The US then moved on, and in June 1958 the central government army landed in Minahasa. The Permesta uprising ended in mid-1961.
The Sumatra and Sulawesi rebellions failed. They even helped to create what they did not want as the center reacted to the threat of rebellion. The central government authority increased while regional autonomy became weaker. Radical nationalism became stronger. Communist party power and Sukarno's power increased while Hatta weakened. Sukarno finally established guided democracy in 1958.
Since the 1998 reforms, the Indonesian government has begun to adopt laws that enhance regional autonomy, the main idea that Permesta fights for.

The Ballon d'Or is a special award given to a football player every single year. It has been given since 1956 by a French news magazine called "France Football". From 2010 to 2015, it was combined with another award called FIFA World Player of the Year, and together they were known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. However, in 2016, they separated again, and the award returned to its original name, the Ballon d'Or. FIFA also started giving its own separate award called The Best FIFA Men's Player. 
The Ballon d'Or was created by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran. It is given to the male player who is considered to have performed the best in the previous season. Football journalists used to do the voting for this award from 1956 to 2006. At first, it was only given to players from Europe and was called the European Footballer of the Year award. But in 1995, it was expanded to include players from any part of the world who have played for European clubs. After 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also allowed to vote. This made the award a global prize, and any professional football player from around the world became eligible to win it. In 2022, France Football changed some rules for the Ballon d'Or. They decided to give the award not for achievements in a calendar year but for a football season. They also made it so that only countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking could vote for the award. There is a different vote each year. It is for individual players to get recognised. Despite its popularity, critics have described the award as a "popularity contest", criticising its voting process and for systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.

= = = E. E. Evans-Pritchard = = =
Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, Kt FBA FRAI (21 September 1902 – 11 September 1973) was a British social anthropologist and ethnographer who is known for studying East African cultures and his early practice of cultural relativism.
Personal life.
Early life.
Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard was born on September 21st, 1902 in Surrey, England. He was the son of a Reverend. He went to Winchester College in Hampshire, England. After, he went to Exeter College in Oxford for a master’s degree in Modern History. In 1927, he got his PhD from the London School of Economics. Evans-Pritchard married Ioma Nicholls in 1939 and the two of them had three sons and two daughters.
Education.
While at the London School of Economics, Evans-Pritchard was taught by the well-known C.G. Seligman and B. Malinowski and influenced by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown all of whom were important anthropologists. Evans-Pritchard, unlike his teachers, saw anthropology as less of a natural science and more about understanding culture and explaining history. Evans-Pritchard soon became known for studying the peoples of Eastern Africa. His PhD thesis was about the Azande people of modern South Sudan. He would continue to study and work with the Azande and other Eastern Africans throughout his life. He spent his time during the Second World War in Sudan and was able to study other East African peoples like the Sansui of Cyrenaica during his military service. At the time, Britain colonized many parts of Africa; Britain used their colonies as bases and staging posts during the war.
Fieldwork and theoretical views.
Azande.
Evans-Pritchard’s spent much of his early career studying the Azande. He had a specific interest in the Azande idea of witchcraft, which to the Azande was of great importance. Whenever something bad, that was not someone’s fault, happened to a member of the Azande, they would blame witchcraft for the issue. Witchcraft was a common, everyday problem for the Azande and it was a major part of their culture. Tests and trials, often done by oracles, would decide whether accused people were witches or not. It is important to note that the Azande did not always believe witch charges and they often challenged rulings. As Evans-Pritchard found, Azande witchcraft was not an excuse for someone making a mistake. The Azande idea of witchcraft had a logic to it.
Nuer.
The Nuer people of people of East Africa were also studied by Evans-Pritchard. Like with the Azande, he took primary accounts of what he saw. He did not apply the views he had of other African cultures to the Nuer without first experiencing them. He explained in detail how the Nuer thought about laws, politics, and their society. The Nuer did not build courthouses or other political buildings, instead most rules and political beliefs were taught through oral histories and stories. The will and the expectation that you would follow these rules only existed a certain distance away from the village that made them.
Cultural Relativism.
Evans-Pritchard is known for being an early supporter for Cultural Relativism. Cultural Relativism is the belief of not judging people's cultures as better or worse compared to your own. A culture is not good or bad, it is just different. While many of Evans-Pritchard's peers considered peoples like the Azande as primitive and lesser, Evans-Pritchard found that they were rational and orderly. He also did not believe that White Europeans were inherently better than other races and this belief can be seen in his writings.
Death and legacy.
Evans-Pritchard is regarded as an important British Anthropologist and Ethnographer. He believed in the importance of fieldwork and unlike many past anthropologists, spent his time visiting and writing about the Azande and Nuer personally rather than only relying on others and writing from home. He lived among those he studied, which allowed him to gather a very excellent description of who he was living with. He was supportive of future students looking at his work and asking questions, so he tried to publish as much of his own work as he could.
Later writers would note some flaws. Evans-Pritchard contradicted himself and has faced criticism over his translation skills. Also, some of his writings about parts of the cultures he studied, such as with the Nuer religion, have flaws. Modern critics note that most of his work was done while the people he studied were ruled under the British Empire. Which to the critics, implies his work has a possible moral problem.
Even though he was criticized, he is thought to have been an excellent writer. Also, he is said to have been a very good ethnographer, an individual who records aspects of a culture. He is remembered as an important anthropologist.
Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard retired in 1970 and was knighted in 1971, a great honor in his native Great Britain. He died in Oxford, England in 1973.

= = = Jamie Vardy = = =
Jamie Richard Vardy (born 11 January 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays for Leicester City as a striker. He is one of the most successful strikers in Premier League.
Vardy won the Premier League title with Leicester in 2016.
He has played for the England national team, but has retired from international play to protect his body from wear and tear. His club contract is by far his main source of income.
Vardy is very unusual, because he was a third division player who made it big when transferred to a Premier League club quite late in his career.
He started his footballing career at the age of sixteen, playing for Stockbridge Park Steels youth system. On his debut for Halifax Town in 2010, Vardy scored the winning goal against Buxton. He was their top scorer for the season, with 25 goals in 37 appearances. After leaving Halifax for Fleetwood Town, he became the season's top scorer with 31 league goals.
In May 2012, Vardy signed for Championship side Leicester City. In 2013-14 season, Vardy got the Leicester's player of the season award, with 16 league goals. The following season, Leicester was promoted to the Premier League. Vardy won his first Premier League Player of the Month award for the month of October in 2015 and won it again in November.
The sports' highlight of the year was when Leicester won the 2015-16 season of the Premier League, one season after promotion. Vardy won the Premier League Player of the Season award and was one of the four Leicester players selected in the PFA Team of the Year. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 22 February 2017. He is the only player in Premier league history to have scored goals in 11 consecutive (one after the other) matches. On 5 July, 2020, Vardy scored 2 goals against Crystal Palace to complete a century of goals in Premier League.
International career.
Vardy was selected for the England squad for UEFA Euro 2016. He made his international debut for England on 7th June, coming as a substitute for Wayne Rooney against the Republic of Ireland. He scored his first goal for England against Germany on 26 March 2016. He was also selected in England's squad for the World Cup 2018.
On 28 August 2018, Vardy "stepped aside" from the England national team. He told manager Gareth Southgate that he did not want to be considered for selection unless there was an injury crisis.

= = = AutoHotkey = = =
AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Microsoft Windows. It allows users to create keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation. It allows users to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application. User interfaces can be extended or modified by AutoHotkey. For example, replacing the Windows control key commands with their Emacs equivalents. The AutoHotkey installation includes a help file. Documentation is available on the internet.
Features.
AutoHotkey scripts can be used to load programs, open documents, and issue keystrokes and mouse clicks.
AutoHotkey scripts can also change variables and manipulate windows, files, and folders.
AutoHotkey scripts can be started by a hotkey. When the user presses a combination of keys, such as on the keyboard, a script could open a web browser.
Keyboard keys can be remapped, such that pressing might result in the active window receiving an en dash (–). The same keys could be disabled, such that pressing might result in nothing happening at all.
AutoHotkey also allows for 'hotstrings' that will automatically replace certain text as it is typed. A typical use for hotstrings is expanding abbreviations. Typing "btw" could be made to produce the text "by the way".
Scripts can be started automatically when the computer starts. These could run in the background and could be used to write information to a logfile.
More complex tasks can be making custom data entry forms (GUI windows), working with the system registry, or using the Windows API by calling functions from DLLs. The scripts can be compiled into an executable file that can be run on other computers that do not have AutoHotkey installed.
The source code is in C++ and can be compiled with Visual Studio Express.
Memory access through pointers is allowed just as in C.
Some uses for AutoHotkey:
History.
The first public beta of AutoHotkey was released on November 10, 2003. It was based on the syntax on AutoIt v2. It used some AutoIt v3 commands and the AutoIt v3 compiler. AutoIt v3 changed its license from GPL to closed source because of "other projects repeatedly taking AutoIt code" and "setting themselves up as competitors."
In 2010, AutoHotkey v1.1 (originally called AutoHotkey_L) became the platform for ongoing development of AutoHotkey. In late 2012, it became the official branch.
Examples.
The following script will allow a user to search for a particular word or phrase using Google. After copying text from any application to the clipboard, pressing the configurable hotkey will open the user's default web browser and perform the search.
The following script defines a hotstring that enables the user to type "afaik" in any program and have it automatically replaced with "as far as I know":
The example below makes replace selected text in an editor with a quoted version of that text. It illustrates the use of functions, arguments and default argument values. 
^+q::QuoteSelection() ; Ctrl+Shift+Q
QuoteSelection()
 selection := GetSelection() ; Get selected text.
 PasteText(Quote(selection)) ; Quote the text and paste it back.
GetSelection(timeoutSeconds := 0.5)
 Clipboard := "" ; Clear clipboard for ClipWait to function.
 Send ^c ; Send Ctrl+C to get selection on clipboard.
 ClipWait %timeoutSeconds% ; Wait for the copied text to arrive at the clipboard.

Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque (built 1192 - 1316) Quwwat-ul-Islam was sponsored by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, founder of the Mamluk dynasty. The Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Islamic conquest of India. 27 Jain and Hindu temples were dismantled and their stonework salvaged into the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters. Perhaps it was the first monument of iconoclast in India. It is in contradiction to Hasan Nizami's account of Aibak as peaceful and 'Lakh Baksh' or 'giver of lakhs' in his book Taj-ul-Masir. It is said he was generous and spent huge sums in charity. But it may also be that the monument was hurriedly built with the building material from the temple as Aibak had not established himself firmly in India at that time.
Quwwat-ul-Islam, the "Glory of Islam," was hastily erected by the young amir, who conscripted an army of local craftsmen, presumably Hindus, to assemble the structure thought there is no evidence to confirm the religious demography of the craftsmen 
The Qūwat-ul-Islām mosque (completed 1196), consisting of cloisters around a courtyard with the sanctuary to the west, was built from the remains of demolished temples celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is built of red sandstone, gray quartz, and white marble, but is probably inspired by the “Iron Pillar " that stands on the site. Built in the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century, it is the only piece of the temple that stands in its original location. Qutb built around it when he constructed the mosque. Although made of iron, it has resisted rust for over 1,500 years.
Later, a lofty arched screen was erected and the mosque was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din Iltutmish (A.D. 1210 - 1235) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra. A deep socket on the top of the ornate capital indicates that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into it.

Minh Mạng ([mïŋ˧ maːŋ˧˨ʔ]; 25 May 1791 – 20 January 1841), personal name Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, also known as Nguyễn Phúc Kiểu, was the second emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty in Vietnamese History. His reign lasted 21 years, from 1820 until his death in 1841.
Biography.
Emperor Minh Mạng was the fourth son of Emperor Gia Long; his mother was Trần Thị Đang, second wife of Gia Long (conferred Empress Dowager Nhân Tuyên later). Three eldest son of Gia Long, Crown prince Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, "Duke of Thuận An" Nguyễn Phúc Hy and prince Nguyễn Phúc Tuấn, had died before their father, so Minh Mạng was the eldest son of Gia Long at that time.
Minh Mạng is reported to have 142 children from 43 wives. He also had many concubines whose childless, and not be reported in royal pedigree. The first wife of him was Empress Consort Tá Thiên Hồ Thị Hoa, mother of Emperor Thiệu Trị, but she died after 13 days giving birth. The second wife, "First-rank of Royal Concubine Hiền phi" Ngô Thị Chính, was the most beloved wife of Minh Mạng, but she had not been conferred as Empress Consort.

= = = Ngô Thị Chính = = =
Ngô Thị Chính (or Chánh) (1792 – 1843) was an imperial consort of Emperor Minh Mạng of the Nguyễn Dynasty in Vietnamese History.
Biography.
Ngô Thị Chính was born in Đăng Xương, Huế, daughter of "Attorney General" Ngô Văn Sở and lady Nguyễn Thị Đích. She also had 2 younger brother named Thắng and Thọ.
Lady Chính married Minh Mạng while he was still as Crown Prince. In 1820, Minh Mạng crowned, lady Chính was granted the title "Cung tần" ("Imperial maid"), as well as other concubines of him. Because at that time, lady Hồ Thị Hoa had died after giving birth to Miên Tông (Thiệu Trị later), lady Chính was the primary wife of Minh Mạng, leader of the harem. 
Not long after that, she was granted Tam giai Hiền tần ("Third-rank of Royal Concubine Hiền tần"). The First and Second-rank was emptied, so Hiền tần still kept the highest rank in the harem. In 1836, she was elevated to Nhất giai Hiền phi ("First-rank of Royal Concubine Hiền phi").
Although more than 40, Hiền Phi still gave birth to a son, proving that she was still loved by the emperor despite her age.

= = = Larinus planus = = =
Larinus planus is a weevil, an insect of the Curculionidae family. It is native to Europe, and is also common in North America. Both the larvae and adults feed on flower buds, mostly of thistles. They are oval shaped, dark brown or black, and about 5-10 millimeters long.
The larvae stage does the most damage to the flower bud. In North America it has been used as a biocontrol agent.
"Larinus planus" has been used in North America to control the creeping thistle, a weed from Europe. It has spread to other plants. In 2000, it was found eating "Cirsium undulatum". This is a thistle native to western Colorado and eastern Utah. Later research found that it had reduced the amount of seeds produced by the native thistle. It has also been found to have a bad effect on "Cirsium pitcheri".
It is normal for introduced species to spread rapidly because they are free of the parasites and predators of their native land.

= = = Garfield Minus Garfield = = =
Garfield Minus Garfield, also known as Jon Arbuckle, is a comic published on the internet and created by Dan Walsh, a technology manager from Dublin, Ireland, that received notably large attention during 2008. Each comic strip consists of a previous "Garfield" comic strip with every character except Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle removed. Dan Walsh says he was not the first to come up with this idea, but was the first to popularize it.
Paws, Inc. publishes a similarly named and themed comic strip every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and later every Tuesday.
Content.
Because Garfield is not present, the comic strips mostly show his owner, Jon Arbuckle, interacting with himself instead of Garfield. The comic strip's website calls this "a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb."
Reception.
"Garfield" creator and artist Jim Davis has said he occasionally reads the comic strip, it fascinates him, and he finds it to be an "inspired thing to do". Some variations of the idea have also been created, such as a Garfield Minus Jon Tumblr blog.
Publication.
On October 28 2008, Ballantine Books released a "Garfield Minus Garfield" book in full color, with the original comics alongside the edited ones. It is credited to Jim Davis, who officially allowed it to be published, with an introduction written by Dan Walsh. However, most of the content inside the book consists of a section with "Garfield Minus Garfield Strips by Dan", ending with "A word from Jim Davis" and a small section of Jim Davis' own attempts at making "Garfield Minus Garfield" comic strips.
Paws, Inc. published its own "Garfield Minus Garfield" from November 3, 2008 to July 21, 2010, and resumed publishing on April 25, 2012. Unlike Dan Walsh's version, Paws, Inc.'s version also includes the original "Garfield" comic strip underneath.

= = = Albany adder = = =
The Albany adder is a viper that is less than a foot long and is also a highly venomous snake, native to South Africa. It is the most rare and endangered snake in South Africa. The Albany Adder has a rare brown and red pattern on its scales. It also seems to have horns over its eyebrows. The Adder reaches sexual maturity between 3 and 4 years of age. They can live around 15 years old in the wild. 
History.
This breed was found in the 1990s. There have only been a dozen found, one was found dead. The last was found and recorded in 2007. A group of reptile experts went looking for this hard to find snake and were only able to find two during their first day. In 2014, the Albany Adder was put on the Critically endangered species list as the most endangered reptile. This snake was a month from being extinct due to the rule of a species not being found and recorded in a ten year span. If not recorded in this time frame, it is labeled as extinct.
Habitat &amp; Habits.
Due to the loss of the snake's home there have been few sightings of this snake. Scientists are keeping the location of the snake a secret in order to save it. There are now rules for their lands. The snakes reside in small plants and tiny trees. Reptile experts know nearly nothing about the what the Albany Adder eats, how they have babies, and the way they act. 
Scientists know what other Adders eat, how they have babies, and how they behave. They have reason to believe that these habits are similar to the Albany Adder.
Adders eat small Mammals. small Reptiles, nesting Birds, and Amphibians. Scientists think Albany Adders mate nearly the same way as other Adders. Females can produce around 10-12 babies who go off on their own shortly after being born.

= = = Needle felting = = =
Needle felting is a dry felting technique which employs one or more specially designed needles to manipulate wool fibers. This technique is used by artists and craftspeople to sculpt objects and embellish textiles with wool. Needle felting can be used to create soft sculpture, dolls, figurines, and 2 dimensional wool paintings.
History.
Needle felting dates back to the 1980s. The technique was adapted from industrial felting by David &amp; Eleanor Stanwood. They took needles from a wool factory and used them to create handmade felt without the use of water or soap. The skills for needle felting were passed on to Ayala Talpai who wrote books and taught others to needle felt. Today, needle felting is still not as popular as wet felting. However, it has a strong following with people who enjoy arts and crafts.
Materials.
Finger gloves.
Finger gloves are small leather strips that cover the index finger and thumb in order to protect fingers from injury. Finger gloves can be useful for beginners, but contact with a hard surface can damage or break delicate felting needles.
Felting cushion.
A cushion or mat is required for needle felting. A mat is used to protect both the delicate felting needles as well as the work surface below. A felting mat can be made out of many materials, but are commonly foam, sponge, or other soft materials that can withstand repeated puncture by the needle without causing damage to it.
Felting needle.
Felting needles are the most important tool for needle felting. They are specially designed with notches or 'barbs' all along the shaft to mat and lock wool fibers together. They come in a variety of sizes: smaller needles have finer barbs and can be used for more detailed work, while larger needles have thick barbs and can create felt faster than other needle sizes. The needle size is measured in gauges ranging from 12 to 42. It is a measurement of how many needles fit in a square inch. That means the higher the gauge, the smaller the needle.
Wool.
The wool that is typically used for needle felting is called roving or batting - wool that has been cleaned and carded is packaged this way for spinning and other fiber crafts. Many different types of wool are suitable for needle felting. Sheep's wool is most common, but other animal fibers and even some plant and synthetic fibers can be needle felted.
Process.
Needle felting starts by placing a cushion or mat on a flat surface. To create a 3D object, a small amount of wool is tightly rolled up into a small bundle. The wool is then stabbed over and over again with the felting needle to lock the fibers together, eventually creating a firm texture that is called felt. Adding more wool and poking it repeatedly into the felt expands the object until it achieves the desired shape. Needle felting can also be used to create 2D wool paintings. For this process, wool is applied to an existing piece of felt or fabric. Small amounts of fiber are painstakingly poked into the fabric to create the desired image.

= = = Flemish Giant rabbit = = =
The Flemish Giant rabbit is one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbits, earning the name, "King of Rabbits." Originally, these rabbits were bred for their fur and meat. It's origins are quite vague. It is believed that these rabbits are descended from the Patagonia Rabbit, possibly crossed with another rabbit. Also, no one is sure as to what region these rabbits are from.
The difference in does (females) and bucks (males) can be told by looking at their head. Bucks have a broader head while does' are dainty and have a dewlap, a fold of skin under their chin, used to keep kits (baby rabbits) warm.
The Flemish Giant rabbit has other nicknames besides "King of Rabbits." The name "Gentle Giants" was earned because unlike the smaller domestic rabbit, Flemish Giants are known for being much more calm and gentle. They are also called the "Universal Rabbit" mainly for being great pets and show animals, although, it could also be because of their use as a resource for food and material.
Size.
"Giant" obviously comes from their large size. "Flemish" was the language spoken in the region where they were being bred. Their large size does mean a bit more of food and maintenance but these rabbits can be taken care of the same way the normal domestic sized rabbits would be taken care of.
Fur.
Their glossy fur is short and dense. Their coats come in seven different colors; light gray, steel gray, black, fawn, sandy, white, and blue.
Growth.
Mature Flemish Giants weigh 13-14 lbs on average but they can weigh up to 20 pounds, even a bit more. They can grow to be bigger than some dogs. On average, the Flemish Giant can grow to 2 1/2 in length. The longest Flemish Giant recorded is 4 ft. 3 in. The typical ear length for them is 8 inches.

= = = Thai street food = = =
Thai street food is a market place in Thailand where vendors set up stalls to sell food and people buy to enjoy on the go or directly on nearby tables. This event is set up throughout the day with many different Thai cuisines and desserts such as popular dishes like "Som Tam," which is a salad made from shredded green papayas topped with tomatoes, lime, peanuts, garlic, and chili peppers and "Pad Thai" which is known as the country’s famous stir-fried noodles with any kind of meat such as pork, beef, chicken, or shrimp. They also have popular desserts such as "Khao Niao Mamuang" or mango sticky rice made with a bed of sticky rice at the bottom with a fresh mango cut into slices on top and finished off with a drizzle of sweet coconut milk; these foods are usually served as a small portion, just enough for one at a very low price.
Foods.
There are many Thai cuisines displayed from noodles to curries, soups to salad, and many sweet desserts. One popular noodle soup, "Guay Teow," is made from rice noodles or egg noodles with beef, pork, and chicken stock. Sometimes vendors add wantons, which are small dumplings or meat balls, to the broth. The Thai version of spaghetti and meatballs is called "Pad See Eiw." It's a noodle dish made from wide and thick rice noodles that is stir fried in dark soy sauce with either pork, chicken, or beef and Chinese broccoli or cabbage. It's a great substitute from pad thai because it's not spicy, although some ask for dried chili flakes on the side. Those who enjoy food can also add vinegar to liven the dish. Another unique street food dish is "Massaman Gai," which is a curry that comes from Persia. This dish is flavored with Cinnamon, Tamarind sauce, and sugar, topped with roasted peanuts and bay leaves, it's made with coconut milk, potatoes, and chicken or tofu for vegetarians.
Desserts.
Thai street also has desserts. These can be wrapped or serve in other unique ways. “Khao Lam” which is Bamboo sticky rice, is served inside a bamboo stick roasted in charcoal. The inside can have white sticky rice or black sticky rice filled with black beans or sesame. The bamboo gives this dessert a unique taste. Diners crack open the top and then pull down each bamboo strip like a flower until the sticky rice is reached. This dessert's price range is from 14 cents (US) to as much as $2. Thai desserts also include ice cream. Being one of the hottest places in the world, there are a lot of stalls that sell many ice cream desserts like “Itim Kati” or coconut ice cream. This dessert is made out of coconut milk with a soft texture, a blend between creamy and icy. It's served in a coconut shell and is as cheap as 57 to 86 cents (US). There is also a unique dessert that can be found in Thai street markets called “Bua Loy Nam King” or Black sesame dumplings in ginger soup. This street dessert is originally from China. It is filled with warm spicy Ginger soup with rice flour dumplings that have black sesame paste on the inside, it’s texture is soft and chewy.

= = = The Angriest Dog in the World = = =
The Angriest Dog in the World is a comic strip created by film director David Lynch.
Background.
Lynch came up with the idea for the comic strip in 1973 during a time when he was feeling very angry. The comic strip was first published in the "LA Reader", and ran from 1983 until 1992. The comic strip was also serialized in "Cheval Noir".
Each comic strip is introduced with a small caption featuring this text:
Each strip is visually the same. The first three panels are identical, and feature the black dog growling, tied to a post in a yard by a chain. He is between a tree on the left and one wall of a house with a window on the right. The fourth panel is the same as the previous three panels, except it is night time and a circle of light is coming from the house's window.
A word balloon appears in one or more of the panels, showing one of the members of one of the house's unseen family, either Bill, Sylvia, Pete or Billy, Jr, is speaking. The speech is usually an aphorism or a non-sequitur. Such sayings include: "If everything is real... then nothing is real as well." and "It doesn't get any better than this."
In a short essay on Lynch's "Rabbits", Objectif Cinema notes:
David Lynch has of course used animals within his back catalogue of work before. Dogs for instance feature in nearly every one of his movies usually as a visual prop: who could forget the scene in "Wild at Heart" in which our canine friend scampers away with the Bank teller's severed hand? Or the mewling pups in Mary X's living room in "Eraserhead"? Indeed a dog, albeit in cartoon form, took centre stage in Lynch's cartoon series for the "LA Reader", "The Angriest Dog in the World". But it is here on his website that Lynch seems to be opening up more to the wonders of nature: Bees, Coyotes and Dead Mice all have a part to play in various guises and manifestations within www.davidlynch.com, and as part of the pay-per-view series, the Rabbit has been given the starring role.

The 2019 Hyderabad gang rape was the murder of a 26 year old veterinary doctor. It had an effect across all of India.
Her body was found in Shadnagar on 28 November 2019, a day after her death. Four suspects were arrested and, according to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Police, confessed to having raped and killed the doctor. On 6 December, the police took the accused to the scene of the crime, and shot them dead, prompting accusations of extrajudicial execution and celebrations of the killings. 
The following account is based on the police report. The victim had parked her scooter near a toll plaza, and caught the attention of two lorry drivers and their assistants. They deflated her tire, pretended to help her, and pushed her into nearby bushes, where they raped and smothered her. Then they loaded her corpse onto a lorry and dropped it on the roadside.
The police got evidence from CCTV cameras and from the victim's mobile phone. The accused were arrested and were put in Cherlapally Central Jail for fourteen days. The Telangana Chief Minister ordered a fast-track court to try the accused for their alleged crimes. 
The rape and murder caused outrage in several parts of the country. Protests and public demonstrations against rape were organized nationwide after the incident, with the public demanding stricter laws against rape and rapists. The Minister of Home Affairs criticized the Telangana Police and stated that the government intended to amend the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure to introduce laws for quicker punishment by fast-track courts.
All four accused were killed by police on 6 December 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore Hyderabad national highway, while they were in police custody. According to the police, the suspects were taken there for a reconstruction of the crime scene. Two of them allegedly snatched guns and attacked the police. In the ensuing shootout, all four suspects were shot dead. 
Thousands of people celebrated the men's deaths. The event has no religious angle : the accused included men of both main religions.

= = = PartiallyClips = = =
PartiallyClips is a comic published on the internet that was created by Rob Balder and ran from 2002 to 2015. At the start of 2010, Balder gave authorship of the comic to Tim Crist, the comedy musician behind Worm Quartet.
Premise.
"PartiallyClips" is a constrained comic. Each three-panel strip consists of the same clip art image (the comic has no original art) in each panel for the whole strip, with added speech balloons and/or captions to create the joke.
"PartiallyClips" frequently tends to use dark humor because the picture used shows peace, which is common in public-domain clip art, but the added dialogue or captions make it instead not show peace. "PartiallyClips" also frequently comments on modern life and culture, especially aspects of Internet culture. No characters or plots often repeat.
Its name is a derivation from a misinterpreted phrase that results from a mishearing of the name because "Partially Clips" sounds similar to "Partial eclipse".
Distribution and reception.
"PartiallyClips" was updated twice every week, on Sundays and Thursdays. The "partiallyclips.com" website stopped updating on 17 June 2015. During 2018, the PartiallyClips website went down, and remains unavailable as of August 2019. The archives were available on the Erfworld domain, but are not available there anymore because that domain has largely been taken down due to personal tragedy.
In addition to being published online, the strip was also self-licensed to print media, being targeted at alternative weekly newspapers. It appeared in about 25 newspapers and magazines, and was published in a book called "Suffering For My Clip Art: The Best Of Partially Clips Volume 1". Material from "PartiallyClips" was included in "".
PartiallyClips was included in a short list of comics published on the internet that was included in an NPR article released in 2009. The article's author, Glen Weldon, called it "a combination of found art, a finely honed comic sensibility, and awesomeness run rampant."

= = = FrogPhone = = =
The FrogPhone is a machine that uses microphones to listen to frogs so scientists can study them and the places they live. It also has thermometers to measure how hot or cold it is in the air and water.
Scientists plan to place the FrogPhone machine in a swamp or other place where frogs live and then leave. The FrogPhone works off of two lithium batteries that are recharged by a solar panel. This way, the humans do not have to come back to change the batteries, so they do not disturb the plants or animals.
Scientists can use their cellular phones to call the FrogPhone and either listen to what is happening where the FrogPhone is at that time or make a recording to listen to later or to send to a database for other people. FrogPhone only works in places that have 3G/4G cell phone coverage, but scientists think it could be used with satellites in the future.
Invention.
Australian scientists invented the FrogPhone in 2019. The team had members from the University of New South Wales at Canberra and the University of Canberra and they worked with the Australian Capital Territory, Region Frogwatch Program, and Australian National University. As of December 2019, FrogPhone has been tested but not used in the real world.

Over 430 "official" freeware games and applications were released for the Cybiko. Because it could be used to send text messages, it had a QWERTY keyboard used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on and a SmartMedia card reader were made for the Cybiko. The company stopped manufacturing the Cybiko after two product versions. Multiple Cybikos can communicate with each other from up to 300 metres (0.19 miles) away. Several Cybikos can be used for chatting with each other in a wireless chatroom. Over 500,000 Cybiko Classics were sold by the end of 2000.

The CPU is a Hitachi H8S/2241 running at 11.0592 MHz. The Cybiko Classic also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor running at 4 MHz so it can support RF communications. It comes with 512KB of ROM flash storage and 256KB of RAM. It comes with an add-on slot in the back.
The Cybiko Classic came in five colors: blue, purple, neon green, white, and black. The black version has a yellow keypad, instead of the white unit the other Cybikos have.
The add-on slot has the same pin arrangement as a PC card, but it is not electrically compatible.

It has various improvements over the original Cybiko, such as a faster processor, more RAM, more ROM, a new operating system, a new keyboard layout, a new case design, a bigger wireless range, a microphone, improved audio output and a smaller size.
The CPU is a Hitachi H8S/2323 running at 18 MHz. Just as with the original version, it also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor running at 4 MHz so it can support RF communications. The Cybiko Extreme comes with 512KB ROM flash storage and 1.5MB RAM. It comes with an add-on slot in the back, but the only hardware released that can be connected to it is an MP3 player.
Two variants of the Cybiko Xtreme were released. The US variant (Model No. CY44801), which had a frequency range of 902-928 MHz, and the European variant (Model No. CY44802), which had a frequency range of 868-870 MHz. There were no other functional differences between those variants.
Options.
1MB Expansion Memory.
It is a add-on card that gave the Cybiko 1 megabyte of static RAM and 1 megabyte of flash storage. The RAM allowed Cybiko programs that need more RAM to run. The flash storage allows more Cybiko programs to be stored. Some Cybiko programs would not run if the 1MB Expansion Memory is not connected to the add-on slot.

She was a member of the Parliament of Finland from 2015 to 2023. She was the Minister of Transport and Communications for a short time in 2019.
After Antti Rinne left his position as prime minister, the Social Democratic Party of Finland selected Marin as its candidate for the new prime minister on 8 December 2019. Taking office at age 34, she is the youngest person to hold the office in Finnish history.
As prime minister, Marin was in charge of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. She called out the human rights abuses of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. With President Sauli Niinistö, she announced that Finland would apply for NATO membership in May 2022. She was also criticized, mainly because of a October 2020 photoshoot and leaked private party videos. In 2022, she was called by an "the icon of progressive leadership" by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The SDP finished third in the 2023 parliamentary election, ending Marin's time as prime minister in June 2023. Three months later, she retired from politics.
Early life.
Sanna Mirella Marin was born on 16 November 1985 in Helsinki. Her parents split up when she was very young. The family faced financial problems and Marin's father, Lauri Marin, was an alcoholic. After her biological parents separated, Marin was brought up by her mother and her mother's female partner.
Marin graduated from the Pirkkala High School in 2004 at the age of 19. She joined the Social Democratic Youth in 2006 and was its first vice president from 2010 to 2012. She worked in a bakery and as a cashier while studying. She graduated with a bachelor's and master's degree in Administrative Science from the University of Tampere.
Early political career.
Marin's political career began when she was aged 20. She unsuccessfully ran for election to the City Council of Tampere, but was elected in the 2012 elections. She became chairperson of the City Council within months, from 2013 to 2017. In 2017, she was re-elected to the City Council.
Marin was elected second deputy chairperson of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 2014. In 2015, she was elected to the Finnish Parliament as an MP from the electoral district of Pirkanmaa. Four years later, she was re-elected. On 6 June 2019, she became the Minister of Transport and Communications.
On 23 August 2020, Marin was elected chair of the SDP, replacing Antti Rinne.
Prime Minister (2019–2023).
In December 2019, Marin was nominated by the Social Democratic Party to replace Antti Rinne as the Prime Minister of Finland, but Rinne stayed as party leader until June 2020. By a small amount of votes, Marin beat Antti Lindtman to become prime minister. A majority of the ministers in her cabinet are women, 12 out of 19 at the time of the cabinet's creation. She is the third female head of government in Finland, after Anneli Jäätteenmäki and Mari Kiviniemi.
When she was confirmed by Parliament at the age of 34, she became Finland's youngest-ever prime minister, and was the youngest state leader until Sebastian Kurz became Chancellor of Austria again in January 2020.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Marin's cabinet declared a state of emergency in Finland to stop the epidemic in the country. When Swedish prime minister Stefan Löfven could not attend a European Council meeting in October 2020, Marin also represented Sweden in the meeting. Marin later asked Löfven to represent Finland at a Council meeting later that month.
In October 2020, Marin took part in a photo shoot for the Finnish magazine "" in which she wore a blazer with nothing underneath, causing controversy while her supporters called the critics sexist.
In May 2021, Finnish media reported that Marin and her family were paying about €300 per month for groceries with public funds as a part of the Prime Minister's tax-free housing benefits. This was legally questioned if a prime minister was able to do this. Marin had used around 14.000 euro for her own food, which was over the limit of 2500 euro. Marin claimed that she did not know the limit.
In early December 2021, Marin went celebrating in a nightclub in Helsinki hours after being in close contact with Finland's foreign minister who had tested positive for COVID-19, making her exposed to the disease. Two text messages were sent to Marin's government phone saying that she should be quarantined. However, Marin missed the messages because she was not carrying the phone at the time. According to the government instructions, the Prime Minister should always have the governmental phone. She apologized on Facebook and said that she had been told that going out in public was allowed because she was vaccinated. Two complaints about Marin's actions were sent to the Chancellor of Justice. Important members of the coalition party Centre Party said that Marin had lied to them by chaning her reasoning of going out.
In early 2022, Marin announced her support of Finland joining NATO, causing a negative reaction from Russia. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Marin strongly wanted Finland to join NATO and called on several NATO countries to support their membership. On 25 February, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson threatened Finland and Sweden with "military and political consequences" if they tried to join NATO. 
On 12 May 2022, ten weeks after the beginning of the invasion, President Sauli Niinistö and Marin both said that "Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay" and that a NATO membership would be good for the country's security. On 15 May, Niinistö and Marin announced that Finland would apply for NATO membership, and on 17 May the Finnish parliament approved the proposal 188-8. She said her country did not want permanent NATO bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. On 31 May, she supported a deal agreed by all European Union leaders to ban more than 90% of Russian oil by the end of the year.
In August 2022, another video showed Marin dancing at another party, which caused controversy because people thought Marin was on drugs while dancing at the party. Marin took a drug test on her own to prove she was not on drugs and on 22 August, the results of the test came out negative for drugs in her system.
In October 2022, Marin apologised to the indigenous Sámi people for the problems in the reform of the Sámi human rights legislation. The legislation has been proposed for three parliamentary terms without any progress. In November, ministers voted 11–3 to send the legislation to the Finnish Parliament. On 24 February 2023, the constitutional law committee voted 9–7 to suspend work on the bill, preventing the legislation from being passed.
In March 2023, the SDP finished third in the 2023 parliamentary election, and soon acknowledged her defeat.
On 7 September 2023, Marin announced her plans to resign as an MP to work as a strategic advisor at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. On 12 September 2023 she formally resigned from the Finnish Parliament.
Post-political activities.
On 28 September 2023, it was reported that she had signed with talent agency Range Media Partners.
In January 2024, Marin started working in a new committee called "International Task Force on Security and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine". According to a statement released by the Ukrainian president's office, the committee's primary role is to create a plan for Ukraine's closer engagement with the Euro-Atlantic security area.
Personal life.
In January 2018, Marin and her fiancé, football player Markus Räikkönen, had a daughter, Emma. In August 2020, Marin and Räikkönen were married at the prime minister's official residence, Kesäranta. The couple divorced in May 2023, after 19 years together.
Marin said she came from a "rainbow family", as she was raised by same-sex parents. She was the first person in her family to go to a university.
Marin is a vegetarian.
Marin was on the list of the BBC's "100 Women" in 2020. That same year, she was chosen by "Forbes" on the list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.

= = = Bhupathy's purple frog = = =
Bhupathy's purple frog ("Nasikabatrachus bhupathi") is a frog species belonging to the family Sooglossidae. It lives in the Western Ghat mountains in India. It is a purple cave frog that lives underground almost all the time.
Bodies.
Many species of frog dig underground a little, but Bhupathy's purple frogs live undergound almost all the time. They have front limbs shaped like shovels for digging and long noses so they can stick their tongues aboveground and lick the surface to catch ants to eat. They do not have shoot-and-pull-back tongues like other frogs. 
Adult frogs have purple skins and a thin blue ring around each eye.
The frog has one close relative, the purple frog, "N. sahyadrensis", which was first found in the Western Ghats in 2003.
Life cycle.
The tadpoles do not swim in ponds or streams. Instead, they grab the stones behind waterfalls, where they spend six months eating algae. Young frogs, called imagos, have brown skin. They turn purple when they are adults.
Adult frogs only come aboveground when the rain falls at the beginning of the northeast monsoon season, when they find mates. 
Discovery.
Scientists from Hyderabad's Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology discovered the frog in 2017. They named the frog after scientist Dr. Subramaniam Bhupathy, who died in the Western Ghat Mountains in 2014. They wrote about "N. bhupathi" in "Alytes", the official magazine of the International Society for the Study and Conservation of Amphibians. They found "N. bhupathi" by listening for frog sounds coming up from underground.
"This frog lineage is very ancient, and has a very low diversity, so this finding is very special and unusual," said Elizabeth Prendini of the American Museum of Natural History, who helped write the scientific paper about the discovery.
The scientists did not to say exactly where they found the sample frogs because it was on private property.
This discovery was paid for by the Indian government in a project to sample the DNA of every frog in the country. 
Other ideas.
Some scientists said that because "N. bhupathy", which lives in India, has close relatives in the Seychelles, which are close to Africa, it is likely that the Gondwanaland idea of why the continents are where they are is right. This idea says that Africa and India used to be one large continent, called Gondwanaland.

= = = Horsetooth Reservoir = = =
Horsetooth Reservoir is a man-made lake just west of Fort Collins, Colorado, in southern Larimer County made for recreation purposes, and is the main water supply for the Poudre Valley. The reservoir was a part of the Colorado-Big Thompson project. This project was made to move water from the west slope to the east slope. The water is used for local farms, hydropower, and drinking water for Northern Colorado. The lake is 6.5 miles long and had 25 miles of shore line with 4 camping areas, 111 campsites total, and 4 boat-launch areas. The primary activities are fishing, power boating, water skiing, hiking, and camping.
History.
This reservoir was created on top of the town of Stout. Stout was a small town with a population of 47 1/2. This town had a sandstone mine, and had a railroad that went through it. This town turned into a gost town and horsetooth reservoir was build on top of it. To this day when the water is low enough visitors can still see the buildings where Stout used to be. Horsetooth reservoirs damn began being built in 1949. In 1954, the water was used for farms until the 1970 and then only 80 percent of the water was used for farms. In the 1990's just a little over half of the water supply was used for farms and the other half was used for drinking and hydropower. This reservoir was the largest created during the Colorado-Big Thompson project. Building was finished in 1949 and water first entered the reservoir in 1951. Horsetooth was given its name because of an Arapaho legand that on the west side of the reservoir at the top of a mountain. There is a rock that Natives thought looked like a giant's heart and then later decided that it looked more like a horse's tooth.

Alison Lorraine Cronin, MBE (born September 1966) is the director of Monkey World in Dorset, England, a place of refuge for primates that have been treated badly and not taken care of properly, from the United States. She is widely accepted to be an international expert in rescuing and rehabilitating such primates, and enforcing international treaties aimed at protecting them from illegal trade and experimentation.
Alison Cronin and her husband got an MBE in 2006 for Services to Animal Welfare, as well as starting the Endangered Asian Species Trust.
Early life and career.
Alison Cronin was born in September 1966 as Alison Lorraine Ames in San Diego, California. She studied biological anthropology at Cambridge University. She met Jim Cronin at Monkey World in 1993 while she was living in the UK. They married in 1996. They were joint directors of Monkey World. After her husband died, Cronin continued running the site and working against the illegal transportation of animals.
Alison Cronin became known through the television series "Monkey Business", which was made by Meridian Broadcasting and shown on ITV Meridian in the UK and on Animal Planet worldwide, which has recorded the frequent rescue missions and undercover investigations all around Europe and Asia. The show began in 1998 with "Monkey Business", which was then replaced with "Monkey Life" in 2007. It covers the low and high-profile rescues, one of the most dramatic being in January 2008 when Cronin led a huge rescue of 88 Capuchin monkeys from Chile.
In 2008, Alison Cronin led the creation of the Dao Tien Endangered Primate Rescue Centre located in Cát Tiên National Park, Southern Vietnam which is a rescue, rehabilitation, and release centre focusing on golden-cheeked gibbons, black-shanked douc langurs, silvered langurs, and pygmy loris.

= = = Jim Cronin (zookeeper) = = =
James Michael Cronin MBE (15 November 1951 – 17 March 2007) was an American zookeeper. He was the co-founder of Monkey World, a place of refuge for primates that have been treated badly and not taken care of properly, in Dorset, England, in 1987, from the United States. He was widely acknowledged as an international expert in the rescue and rehabilitation of abused primates, and in the enforcement of international treaties aimed at protecting them from illegal trade and experimentation.
Cronin got an honorary MBE from Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for services to animal welfare.
Early life.
Cronin was born on 15 November 1951 in Yonkers, New York, to Italian-Irish parents. He was the son of a union official. He was educated at St Denis School and Lincoln High School. He had a number of jobs after leaving school before becoming a keeper at Bronx Zoo in the 1970s. While he was working there, he realised he wanted to work with animals. He moved to Kent in the UK to work in John Aspinall's zoo in 1980.
Working with primates.
Cronin started working with primates by working as a zoo keeper in various zoos. He came to the UK, where he got a job as a zoo keeper at John Aspinall's zoo at Howletts, where he perfected his skills of primate rehabilitation and care, in 1980. John Aspinall had set up a breeding programme for gorillas which were an endangered species. Jim Cronin's passion for working with primates made him quite successful in his career and encouraged him to wish to eventually build a safe haven for primates that were treated badly. During his years working at John Aspinall's Zoo, he gave himself the necessary experience of dealing with apes on a daily basis in his career path of working with them as well as small monkeys and their complex life needs.
Monkey World.
The biggest rescue the centre undertook was that of the 19 retired stump-tailed macaques from a medical research laboratory in the UK; but the rescue mission in 2008, of the 88 capuchin monkeys from a medical research laboratory in Chile, took the record of the largest rescue of primates in the world.
In 2006, Cronin was awarded an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II for services to animal welfare he was accompanied by Robert Pitts. Cronin has also received the Jane Goodall Award.
The television series "Monkey Business" (made by Meridian Broadcasting and shown on ITV Meridian in the UK and on Animal Planet worldwide) has documented the Cronin's frequent rescue missions and undercover investigations throughout Europe and Asia for the past 10 years. Beginning in 2007, "Monkey Business" was replaced with "Monkey Life", which also documents the goings-on within Monkey World.
Death.
Following a brief battle with liver cancer, Cronin died on 17 March 2007 at the Cabrini Medical Center, Manhattan, New York. He was survived by his daughter Eleanor, from his first marriage, and his wife Alison Cronin. Since his death, Monkey World has been run by Alison and his close friend Jeremy Keeling.
Jim Cronin Memorial Fund.
The Jim Cronin Memorial Fund for Primate Welfare and Conservation was set up for the purpose of continuing Cronin's legacy and for the support of primate conservation and welfare all over the world. It is a UK-registered charity, number 1126939, and is sponsored by Monkey World.

Synopsis.
Willis Seward Keith has graduated Princeton University studying literature. Willie’s mother wants him to continue his studies and get a masters degree. Willie plays piano and wants to go into show business. As a result, Willie meets and starts dating a singer whose stage name is May Wynn. Then the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and Willie is afraid he’ll have to be sent to the army. So that that doesn’t happen, Willie joins the Navy. Willie is assigned to a ship called the USS Caine. He hates the captain for being too laidback and easygoing and sarcastic and not caring about how things look. The captain is then replaced by a new captain named Queeg. Queeg is mean, gets very angry is almost paranoid and always wants everything to be done his way. Queeg makes everyone on the Caine miserable. Tom Keefer, who is trying to write a novel about how horrible the navy is can’t get any work on his book done so he tries to convince Steve Maryk, who is Queeg’s second in command, that Queeg is insane and cannot command a ship in a time of war. Maryk doesn’t want to believe Keefer but then the ship ends up in the middle of a typhoon. Since there is no written rule about how to get out of a typhoon, Queeg tries to get out by following the rule to avoid getting into a typhoon. Since it doesn’t seem to be working Maryk decides Queeg is insane and takes over as captain with Willie’s help. Queeg has them put on trial for mutiny as soon as they get back to the United States. A Jewish lawyer named Lieutenant Barney Greenwald agrees to defend them because no one else will. When the trial begins, Willie realizes that the reason he helped Maryk wasn’t because he thought Queeg was crazy but because he hated Queeg. He still admits to what he’s done in the trial. Keefer, on the other hand, lies to the jury and says he knew nothing about the mutiny until after it happened. Greenwald still wins the trial by getting Queeg to get angry and act like he is completely crazy. Greenwald then goes to Maryk, Keefer, and Willie and tells them that they are guilty and that if there were anyone else willing to defend them he would have been the one to prosecute them. Greenwald says Queeg was actually a hero because while Willie was at Princeton and Keefer was writing his books and Greenwald was defending the Cherokee, Queeg was risking his own life to protect the country so that Greenwald’s mother didn’t get melted down into a bar of soap by the Nazis. Greenwald calls Keefer a coward for having convinced Maryk to mutiny and then betrayed Maryk during the trial. Greenwald then throws wine at Keefer’s face and says he’ll be waiting in the lobby if Keefer wants revenge and that since they are both drunk it will be a fair fight. Maryk is fired from the Navy and Keefer becomes captain. A Japanese kamikaze crashes his plane into the ship, so Keefer jumps and abandons the crew to save his own life. Willie stays on board and actually risks his own life to save everyone else and actually manages to do that. Willie then starts thinking about what is important and decides that he should marry May Wynn and have kids with her. When he comes back to America, she is using her real name and working for a soon to be divorced man who wants to have sex with her though they have not yet since she is not going to have sex with someone to whom she is not married. Willie then meets the man and he realizes that he reminds him of Keefer. Willie then knows that he can and will win her back.

= = = Dip net = = =
A dip net, or hand net, is a toll used to wade through water and catch fish.
Species.
Hooligan, king salmon, red salmon, pink salmon, silver salmon, and flounder are fish that are mostly caught while netting in Alaska. Hooligan, a Chinookan name, is also called a candlefish. This is an important species to eagles, gulls, and bear. This fish is found in the Pacific Northwest of Alaska. The best way to catch them is to dip net them. There is no bag unit limit when catching these fish. Only a valid fishing license will be needed and to be an official Alaskan resident. Hundreds and thousands of hooligan spawn every year in rivers. Salmon are usually born in freshwater, but slowly swim to the saltwater. They lay their eggs on the gravel and the eggs hatch after a month. These little fish are called fry because they look like long little fries when they swim in water. After they hatch, they swim to saltwater and live up to four to six years then they come back to the river, usually not the same river as they were spawned, but in a river that's not running fast. This is because hooligans are not strong swimmers.
King Salmon, a Chinookan salmon, is called king because of how aggressive and large it is. It is 30-40 inches long. They are found in the Southeast of Alaska in Prince William Sound in the Bristol Bay area. This species is highly fished because they are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which makes a good dinner. 
Sockeye salmon, also named a red salmon, are the most popular among the salmon species because of their bright orange flesh. They are found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers. They can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh 4 to 15 pounds. They live to 3–7 years and are eaten by marine mammals and bears.
Pink Salmon, known as humpy fish are found in Southeast of Alaska in Prince William Sound. Males are easily identified by the large hump on their back while females have a slimmer appearance. This area is home to seabirds that feed on them as well as bears, wolves, otters, and bald eagles. Saltwater pinks are smaller than freshwater and have softer flesh. Regular freshwater are 20-25 inches in length. They run with other fish like kings and silvers. These are especially easy to catch because they're easier to trick with the correct angler method.
Silver salmon, deep bodied North Pacific salmon with black spots, are found in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. They grow up to be 30 inches in length and live up to 2–4 years.
Ways to dip net.
There are two types of basic dip netting: stationary and sweeping. There are two stationary techniques. Kick netting is placing a net at the bottom of the river where all of the rocks are and kicking to get fish. Nets are easily damaged this way. The other technique is body rushing, which is using a body to catch fish. When a school of fish rush in the water, swing the body from side to side. This can scare the fish and they should get caught in the net. There are three types of sweeping. Sight dipping is seeing fish in the water and trying to catch the fish. Scooping is digging between rocks blindly into bushes of weeds or large bushes. The last technique is dredging. The net rubs against the bottom of the river picking up mud, weeds and other debris that can trap fish.

= = = Chipko movement = = =
The Chipko movement was a group action in India with the goal of saving trees. This is mainly done through the act of hugging trees to protect them from being cut. It was also known as Chipko Andolan. Those who were part of it used nonviolent protests. The Chipko movement began in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand. It then spread to Uttar Pradesh. By the 1980s it had spread across most of India.
/The Chipko leads to a change in policies to stop the clear cutting of trees in some regions. (Clear cutting is a type of logging where all trees in an area are cut down).
Chipko movement was started by Sunderlal Bahuguna.
The name of the Chipko moment originated from the word 'embrace' as the villagers used to hug the trees/ and protect them from wood cutters from cutting them. In 1731, the king of Jodhpur in Rajasthan asked one of his ministers to arrange wood for constructing a new palace. The minister and workers went to a forest near a village, inhabited by Bishnois, to cut down trees. A Bishnoi woman Amrita Devi showed exemplary courage by hugging a tree and daring king’s men to cut her first before cutting the tree. The tree mattered much more to her than her own life. Sadly, the king’s men did not heed to her pleas, and cut down the tree along with Amrita Devi. Her three daughters and hundreds of other Bishnois followed her, and thus lost their lives saving trees. The incident inspired the several other rural women, who launched such similar movements in different parts of India. The Chipko Movement gained momentum under Sunderlal Bahuguna, an activist, who spent his whole life persuading and educating the villagers, to protest against the destruction of the forests and the Himalayan mountains by the government. The Chipko protests achieved a major victory in 1980 with a 15 years ban on tree felling in the Himalayan forests of the state by the order of Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
Now, even an Amrita Devi Award is given to those involved in wildlife protection and conservation.

= = = Icicle = = =
An icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes.
Various snow spikes are formed on days when the outdoor air temperature is sub freezing and heat from sunlight melts snow or ice on anything sloped. The droplets of water freeze as they loses their heat to the cold air, forming a cone-like shape of ice.
Shape.
Once water starts dripping, it begins to freeze into a certain side. It will melt and freeze over and begin to create icicles. As winter gets longer and temperatures stay in the freezing and sunlight is present, water will just melt and drip alongside the icicle causing them to get longer and sharper. The reason why icicles are pointy is because the water drips in a downward motion. Icicles can range from millimeters to feet in length.
Accidents.
Icicles are beautiful, but they can sometimes be dangerous. Icicles have been reported fatal since the 1700s, from falling on people and causing accidents to property being damaged. Icicles can cause damage on many structures such as buildings and homes, once ice forms layers the weight of it can cause the structure to fall or break off. Icicles can also be formed on bridges over streets and highways creating a potential danger for nearby motor vehicles passing by.

= = = Rydberg constant = = =
In spectroscopy, the Rydberg constant is a physical constant relating to the electromagnetic spectra of an atom. Its symbol is formula_1 for heavy atoms or formula_2 for hydrogen. The constant is named after the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg. The constant first arose as an empirical fitting parameter in the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen spectral series. Niels Bohr later showed that its value could be calculated from more fundamental constants via his Bohr model. , formula_1 and electron spin "g"-factor are the most accurately measured physical constants.
The constant is expressed for either hydrogen as formula_2, or at the limit of infinite nuclear mass as formula_1. In either case, the constant is used to express the limiting value of the highest wavenumber (inverse wavelength) of any photon that can be emitted from an atom, or, alternatively, the wavenumber of the lowest-energy photon capable of ionizing an atom from its ground state. The hydrogen spectral series can be expressed simply in terms of the Rydberg constant for hydrogen formula_2 and the Rydberg formula.
In atomic physics, Rydberg unit of energy, symbol Ry, corresponds to the energy of the photon whose wavenumber is the Rydberg constant, i.e. the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom.

= = = Jeopardy! Teachers Tournament = = =
The "Jeopardy!" Teachers Tournament is an annual tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!" It features full-time teachers of students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. The tournament debuted during Season 27 (2010-2011) and has been played every season since (except for Season 37), always during any of the three ratings sweeps periods (November, February, or May), with the exception of being held from May 25th to June 5th 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Format.
The Teachers Tournament follows the same 10-game format as the Tournament of Champions, College Championship, and Teen Tournament. The first five games are the quarterfinals, where all fifteen participants play in groups of three. The winners of the five games advance to the semifinals. The players with the four highest scores among non-winners advance as "wild card" players. The nine semifinalists compete in the next three games. Then the three semifinal winners advance to the two-day finals, in which cumulative scores from the two games are added to determine the championship (contestants' scores start at $0 in each game).
Prizes.
Cash.
The person who wins the tournament receives a $100,000 prize. The first runner up gets $50,000; and the second runner up gets $25,000. Teachers who are eliminated during the semifinals go home with $10,000, and teachers who are eliminated during the quarterfinals go home with $5,000.
Tournament of Champions.
In addition to the aforementioned cash prize, the winner also earns an automatic spot in the next Tournament of Champions, although one winner (Larry Martin in 2018) died from pancreatic cancer before reaching that tournament. So far, two Teachers Tournaments winners have made it to the finals of the Tournament of Champions (Colby Burnett in 2013 and Francois Barcomb in 2019); only Burnett won the event. 2016 winner Jason Sterlacci is only other winner to advance to the semi-finals of the Tournament of Champions. Burnett was also invited back to the Battle of the Decades in 2014 where he advanced to the semifinals, and was team captain in the All-Star games in 2019, where he drafted 2017 Tournament of Champions finalist Alan Lin and November 2000 College Champion Pam Mueller as his team members. His team finished as the second runner-up in the event. 2015 winner Jennifer Giles also competed in the All-Star games, as a member of Team Buzzy Cohen.

= = = FrogWatch = = =
FrogWatch is a name shared by citizen science programs that do the same thing. In a FrogWatch, people make recordings of frogs and other amphibians that live near them and send the recordings to databases for scientists and other people to hear and study.
Not all FrogWatch programs are run by the same people. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums runs FrogWatch USA, Nature Canada runs FrogWatch Canada, the India Biodiversity Portal runs the FrogWatch in India, and other organizations run FrogWatches in other countries.
In citizen science, scientists ask ordinary people to help with scientific research or other work. Citizen science is one kind of crowdsourcing.
The National Geographic Society developed the program that FrogWatch USA volunteers use to add information and that FrogWatch uses to study it. Volunteers record temperature with thermometers and listen for sounds made by specific types of frogs and toads. FrogWatch USA volunteers listen to and record frog habitats for three and a half minutes, starting one half-hour (30 minutes) after the sun goes down.
Scientists have used FrogWatch to study the way frogs and toads change the places they live, which types of frogs are becoming more numerous and which are becoming less numerous, how many different kinds of frogs live in one place, the way they react to changes in how hot or cold it is, and the way they act during different parts of the year.
History.
The United States Geological Survey started FrogWatch USA in 1998, but the National Wildlife Federation took over in 2002.
Between 1998 and 2005, 1,395 people working with FrogWatch USA visited 1,942 places where frogs live and gave information to FrogWatch. They found 79 different kinds of frogs and toads. This does not count visits, places, or species for FrogWatch Canada or FrogWatches in other countries. In 2006, the National Wildlife Federation looked at FrogWatch USA for the U.S. Geological Survey. It said that FrogWatch was so good for science that the USGS should keep giving it enough money to work. It also said that FrogWatch helped teach people and it made scientific work cost less money.
FrogWatch NT works in northern Australia. It started in 1991 after cane toads came to Australia and caused problems there.

= = = Amiga (record label) = = =
Amiga is a popular music record label in Germany. It used to be a record label of the East German state-owned music publisher VEB Deutsche Schallplatten before becoming a record label of the Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994.
In 1947, actor and singer Ernst Busch became allowed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany to create a music publishing house, which was named Lied der Zeit GmbH ("Song of the Times"). This publishing company included the label Amiga. In the 1950s, Lied der Zeit became VEB Deutsche Schallplatten ("German Records"), a state-owned company that had a monopoly on making records. VEB Deutsche Schallplatten had multiple record labels, each for different genres; Amiga releases included folk, jazz, pop, rock, Schlager music, chanson, and children's music.
After East Germany and West Germany became one country, most of the public state enterprises that were from East Germany were taken into pieces or sold to private investors. The Amiga label and catalog were obtained by Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994, which then became part of Sony Music Entertainment in 2008.
Amiga's catalog has 2,200 albums and about 5,000 singles, or a total of 30,000 titles.

= = = Car design = = =
Car design is the process of determining how cars and other motor vehicles like trucks look and feel. Most cars are designed by a large group of people that usually includes artists and engineers.
Design process.
Typically, cars are designed based on many sketches and drawings, along with computer-aided design models. When the design team is satisfied with the basic shape of the car, a life-size model is sculpted from clay. Details are added to the clay model, and its shape may be changed by a small amount.
Then, the interior design team designs the car's interior, making sure that it fits the needs of the customer. These needs include things like comfort and entertainment systems. High-end cars like luxury cars and supercars have fancy interiors and are designed for an enjoyable driving experience, while utility vehicles like vans have plain, rugged interiors designed to endure various types of cargo.
Other parts of the car, such as the chassis and engine, are designed primarily by engineers, as it is less important for these parts to look attractive than it is for them to work properly.
History.
While most early cars were designed around usability rather than looks, that began to change when American businessman Alfred P. Sloan came up with the idea of changing a car's styling every year. This was done from the 1920s onward to keep cars looking "new" for each year they were sold, leaving customers unhappy with older models of the same car and increasing car sales in the United States. Sloan got this idea from bicycle companies.
After World War I, car companies in European countries focused on luxury, and companies called coachbuilders made bodies for luxury cars. Some of these bodies were customized for especially rich customers.
After World War II, the American economy grew and most American citizens were now able to afford cars. Because cars became more important in the United States, so did their styling, with the most famous American car designer being Harley Earl. The influence of car design would also grow massively in Europe, especially within France, Italy, and Germany.

Style of play.
Marcus Rashford plays either as a center forward or a wide forward. Rashford has said that he prefers playing as a left winger. Rashford uses his speed and dribbling to play direct football. These qualities make him more effective on the wings.
Personal life.
Rashford comes from a working class family; his mother is Melanie Maynard, a single parent who often had to work multiple jobs to feed their family, sometimes skipping meals herself to ensure Rashford and his siblings ate.In 2012, Rashford was invited to an England under-16 training camp, and was later selected to play in the Victory Shield against Northern Ireland under-16s in September, and Wales under-16s in October. Under-16's manager Kenny Swain later revealed that Rashford only played two appearances for the side due to an understanding with coaches at Manchester United regarding him being underdeveloped physically, and also thought the exposure would have been "too much" for him.
Three weeks after making his senior début for United in early 2016, Rashford made his first appearance for the England under-20 team, providing an assist for Kasey Palmer in a 2–1 defeat to Canada under-20s. Despite already making his senior début earlier in the year, Rashford was called up to the England under-21 team for the first time in August 2016 for a fixture in September against Norway under-21s. He scored a hat-trick in the 6–1 home victory over Norway in his only appearance for the team, scoring the third with a penalty, his first since turning professional. Under-21 manager Gareth Southgate praised Rashford for his humility in dropping down to under-21 level.
Despite having already made his senior tournament début, it was expected Rashford would be available for selection for the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with the hopes of gaining more tournament experience. United manager José Mourinho responded to these reports by stating it would make no sense for his development as he was already playing senior football. In April 2017, Mourinho appeared to concede Rashford would attend the tournament, saying he had no right to stop him from participating, but later in the month reiterated his opinion that dropping down wouldn't make sense, with Rashford having gained so much senior experience throughout the season. In May, Rashford made the decision not to go to the tournament, and was instead selected for the senior squad by Southgate, the new manager. Southgate praised the decisions taken by United coaching staff in helping maximise the potential of Rashford by not allowing him exposure at youth level for England, saying his development had been handled well by all parties.
Charity and activism.
Rashford has teamed up with poverty and food waste charity FareShare to provide meals to poor schoolchildren in the Greater Manchester area. Because of COVID-19 related lockdowns, schoolchildren were not receiving free school meals during this time. Eventually, the charity was able to raise enough money to reach four million children across the country. 
On 15 June 2020, Rashford wrote an open letter calling for the UK government to end child poverty. Bowing to the building pressure, the government extended free school meals for children during summer holidays. On 1 September, Rashford collaborated with multiple parties to create Child Food Poverty Task Force to help further this cause. In October, Rashford was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire.

= = = Floppotron = = =
The Floppotron is a musical instrument. It was made by Polish engineer Paweł Zadrożniak. It is made of a set of computer hardware that plays music together. The latest version, the Floppotron 2.0, has 64 floppy drives, eight hard drives, and two flatbed scanners.
Development.
First version.
The first version of the Floppotron was made in 2011. It is made of two floppy drives and an ATMega microcontroller. The sound is made by the magnetic head being moved by its stepper motor. The floppy drive's heads have be moved at the correct speed to make the correct sound.
The instrument became well known thanks to a video of the instrument on YouTube playing the Imperial March, which has more than 6 million views.
2.0 version.
In 2016, Paweł Zadrożniak made a better version of the Floppotron, which has 64 floppy drives, 8 hard drives, and two flatbed scanners. Every column of eight floppy drives is controlled by an ATMega16 microcontroller, and the hard drives are controlled by two SMD MOSFETs that push and pull. The flatbed scanner head are controlled by Arduino Uno boards.
How it works.
Any device that has an electric motor can make sound. Scanners and floppy drives use stepper motors to move the head with sensors that scan an image, or read or write, onto a magnetic disk. The faster the motor, the higher the pitch of the sound the motor makes. Hard disks use a magnet and a coil to tilt the head. When voltage is supplied for long enough, the head speeds up and hits the bound, which makes the "drum hit” sound.
The Floppotron makes MIDI music files into commands that tell each device when to buzz, click, or be silent.
Song covers.
As of April 2019, Paweł Zadrożniak's YouTube page shows more than one hundred songs played with the Floppotron. Some of those songs are Queen's "Bohemian Rapsody", Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", White Stripes's "Seven Nation Army", Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams" and Michael Jackson's "Thriller".

= = = Intellivision Amico = = =
The Intellivision Amico is a video game console made by Intellivision Entertainment. The console was revealed in October 2018 and pre-orders started in April 2019. The console will come out on April 15, 2021, delayed from October 10, 2020, along with 40 games being made for then.
Concept.
Most games will be 2D or 2.5D. Other games will be 3D games the company thinks are easy to play and learn. The company helps studios make games for the console with whatever the studios need. All games will have features they will only have on the console. All games will be rated E (Everyone) or E10+ (Everyone 10+) by the ESRB, or PEGI 3 or PEGI 7 by PEGI. Intellivision Entertainment plan to release new games, motion control games, card games and other tabletop games, educational games, and updated classic video games, such as some Intellivision games, some from Imagic, and Atari and arcade games, of which "Moon Patrol" and "BurgerTime" will come out at about the same time as the console. Some Intellivision compilations will have licenses from third-parties, such as "". Games can be downloaded for $9.99 or less when the console comes out, later a higher amount less than $40, or from an RFID card for US$20 to US$30. All games can be played by one player or, because the goal of the system is to go back to family gaming and co-op with people in the same place because the company thinks modern gaming and web-based multiplayer has gone away from that, up to eight players locally. Online multiplayer is planned for a later date.
History.
Development.
In May 2018, Tommy Tallarico said he planned to make a new Intellivision console, and made a new company, Intellivision Entertainment, becoming the president of it. Intellivision Productions started to name itself Blue Sky Rangers Inc. instead, and Intellivision Entertainment got the video game things they owned instead.
At the Portland Retro Gaming Expo in October 2018, the Intellivision Amico was officially revealed, such as its name, and the fact it would come out on October 10, 2020. Developer kits were expected to go out in Summer 2019.
In May 2019, Intellivision Entertainment announced its first major game exclusive to the console, a third official Earthworm Jim game, and that it got ten people who helped to work on the original "Earthworm Jim" team to work on it, all for Earthworm Jim's 25th anniversary. In June 2019, the Intellivision Amico could first be used in secret at E3 2019, allowing people with influence in the video game industry to play games in development on consoles, and try using the official mobile app that allowed mobile phones to be controllers for the console.
At Gamescom in Cologne, Germany in August 2019, Tommy Tallarico showed a trailer with footage of video games running on the Intellivision Amico to the public for the first time. In October 2019, Tommy Tallarico came to Insomnia Dubai, a gaming convention held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to say they set up an office in Dubai to make the Intellivision Amico come out in the MENA region on October 10, 2020, the same day as in North America and Europe.
Hardware.
Console.
The console has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, HDMI out, an SD card slot, and three USB ports. Two of those USB ports can be used for charging, and the remaining USB port allows the console to store more data. There is a LED ambient lighting system built into the body that can change pattern and color in response to gameplay. This system is known as Interactive Guidance Lighting. This feature is intended to make playing games on the console "fun and memorable" while also helping guide players in an interactive way.
Controller.
The Intellivision Amico comes with two controllers. They can charge wirelessly when they are placed into their cradle, which is on top of the console, charge using a wired USB-C connection, or charge in both ways at the same time. They have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, speakers, a microphone, an accelerometer, force feedback and a gyroscope. They also have a full-color touch screen, four big shoulder buttons, a home button and a 64-way pressure-sensitive directional disc with a ring of LEDs all around it. The controllers come with wrist straps so they do not fly away during game action if they are not held in a secure way. Up to six more controllers can connect to the Intellivision Amico. A smartphone running a free controller smartphone app can be used instead of an Amico controller.
Games.
Tommy Tallarico, who is the president of Intellivision Entertainment, has said the games that will be available for the Intellivision Amico will be about 20% updated and re-imagined versions of classic video games, 20% original new games, 20% sports and recreation, 20% board games, dice games, card games, word games and puzzle games, and 20% educational games. All games will be both single player and multiplayer, with some games allowing up to eight players to play the game at the same time using controllers and/or mobile phones. Some games will have motion controls, using the accelerometer and gyroscope of the controller. Some games will have the Karma Gaming Engine, a feature that is intended to give players of all skill levels a fair level of competition against each other by always changing the difficulty for players based on how well they are doing in the game. Five games will come with the Intellivision Amico, and it will have about forty more games available when it comes out. Five of the six included games have been announced to be "Skiing", "Astrosmash", "Shark! Shark!", "Cornhole", and "Farkle".
These games have been announced to come out for the Intellivision Amico:

Rolli und Rita.
Rolli und Rita are two characters who are teenagers and are animated using computers. In every episode of the series, they appear in a sketch and perform a song.
The characters were said to be the most advanced ones when the series was first shown in 1996. Baxter Hobbins Slides, which was independent, used 3D motion-capture suits with motion sensors to make animated 3D models so the characters could make the same movements as the actors. These 3D models were wireframe models at first, then skin and clothes were added to them. The lip movements of the characters were done by using the real lip movements of the actors filmed behind a blue screen.

= = = Glide (API) = = =
Glide is a 3D graphics API made by 3dfx Interactive for their "Voodoo Graphics" 3D accelerator cards. It was proprietary at first, then 3dfx later made it open source. It was only designed to draw graphics, mostly geometry and texture mapping, in data formats like those used in their cards. It was popular in the late 1990s because 3Dfx 3D accelerator cards were widely used, but became obsolete because Microsoft's Direct3D got better, full OpenGL implementations from other graphics card vendors came out, and 3D hardware became more diverse.
API.
Glide is based on the basic geometry and "world view" of OpenGL 1.1. That version of OpenGL is an API that has 336 calls, most of which were not of use to draw graphics for video games at the time. Glide was designed to only have the features that were of use to draw graphics for video games at the time. The allowed the API to be small enough to fully run using late-1990s hardware.
Use in games.
Voodoo cards dominated the video game market during the last half of the 1990s because they ran fast and Glide was easy to use. The name Glide was chosen to reference OpenGL, which it was based on, while being different enough to not make trademark problems happen. 
Glide wrappers and emulators.
Glide emulator development started in the late 1990s. Before 3dfx ended, the company tried very hard to stop these attempts, ending early emulation projects using legal threats. Before it ended and Nvidia bought its assets, 3dfx made the Glide API, and also the Voodoo 2 and Voodoo 3 specifications, open source. It later became an open source project. No games released after 1999 only support Glide for 3D acceleration (Direct3D and OpenGL are used instead), but Glide emulation is still needed to run older games with hardware acceleration. Because the specifications and code are now open source, multiple emulators and wrappers are available that allow older games that use the Glide API to run on non-Voodoo hardware. Other projects, such as Glidos, allow even older games to use Glide.

A popular meme within the game's fanbase is "Losing is fun!"
Gameplay.
Before the game can be played, a world must be made. The player can choose the size, number of groups, and various other bits of the world. After this, they are shown a world made to their liking and can use it or ask for another.
In "Fortress Mode", the player manages a fortress of dwarves. Among other things, the player is able to construct buildings, build an army, and break holes. Their dwarves must be fed, entertained, and protected from hazards to survive. Hazards include flooding, sieges, magma, and a variety of hostile creatures.
In "Adventure Mode", the player explores the world as their own character. Through exploration, they can gather information on characters and places across the map. Quests can be discovered by listening to friendly NPCs. Most quests focus around killing villains or monsters, and reward fame. Some friendly NPCs can be made into companions, who will aid the player in their travels. The player character has the same needs as the dwarves, including hydration and rest. This mode features a deeper combat system where body parts can be targeted.
In "Legends Mode", the player can read the generated history of their world. Historical figures, artifacts, and battles are described. A historical map of the world is included.
History.
In their youth, the Adams brothers were avid fans of sci-fi and fantasy games. They became curious about computer game development and Tarn worked to learn programming. The two programmed various computer games including "Slaves to Armok: God of Blood", a role-playing game focused around killing goblins. Using much of the system created for "Armok" and inspiration from their mining game "Mutant Miner", they began work on "Dwarf Fortress" in 2002. The game has been in development since 2006, with frequent updates on progress and planned features. The game is free to download and its development is funded through PayPal donations.

= = = Rob Rensenbrink = = =
Rob Rensenbrink (; 3 July 1947 – 24 January 2020) was a Dutch footballer and member of the Netherlands national team that reached two World Cup finals in 1974 and 1978. A creative and prolific left winger or forward, he became a legend in Belgium whilst playing in the great Anderlecht side of the 1970s. He is the UEFA Cup Winners Cup's all-time top scorer, with 25 goals. A talented dribbler as well as a cool finisher and adequate passer, he only ever missed two penalties in his entire career. He was also the first winner of the Onze d'Or. Considered as one of the greatest Dutch players of all time. Rensenbrink was widely regarded to be one of the best left wingers of the 1970s.
Club career.
Born in Amsterdam, Rensenbrink started his career at DWS, an Amsterdam amateur club, before moving to Belgian side Club Brugge in 1969. Between 1971 and 1980 he played for Anderlecht where he enjoyed his greatest club successes. In total when in Belgium he twice won the Belgian Championships, the Belgian Cup five times and at European club level the European Cup Winners' Cup twice (in 1976 and 1978 as well as being runner-up in 1977). Rensenbrink delivered a notable performance in the 1976 final as Anderlecht ran out 4–2 winners against West Ham United. He scored two goals, one from the penalty spot and set up Francois Van der Elst for the fourth goal. Among his team mates was Dutch internationalist compatriot, Arie Haan. In 1980, he left Anderlecht and wound down his career with a spell at Portland Timbers in the NASL, followed by a brief stay with Toulouse in France in 1981.
International career.
Rensenbrink made his international debut for the Netherlands national football team against Scotland in 1968, but picked up relatively few caps due to competition for the forward positions with Johan Cruijff and Piet Keizer. However, Rinus Michels included him for the 1974 FIFA World Cup squad that made the short trip to West Germany.
The Dutch side that took part in the 1974 FIFA World Cup were the pinnacle of Total Football. Most of the 1974 team were made up of players from Ajax and Feyenoord, so Rensenbrink was an outsider and was unfamiliar with playing the system. His preferred position was up front on the left, but that position was already Johan Cruijff's domain, so he played on the left-wing position in midfield, taking over from Ajax player Piet Keizer. He missed one game in the tournament (when Keizer played instead) and was only half-fit for the final after picking up an injury during the semi-final against Brazil. Rinus Michels gambled on Rensenbrink's fitness and played him from start – however he only lasted until half-time and was replaced by René van de Kerkhof. The Netherlands took an early lead through a Johan Neeskens penalty, but goals from Paul Breitner and Gerd Müller gave West Germany a 2–1 victory. Rensenbrink's performances saw him named to the team of the tournament and he was sought by Ajax as a replacement for Keizer. However, contract negotiations fell through and he remained at Anderlecht.
Rensenbrink stayed in the Netherlands national team during the qualifiers and finals of the 1976 European Football Championship. However, the Netherlands fell at the semi-final stage to Czechoslovakia.
In the 1978 FIFA World Cup tournament in Argentina, the Netherlands again reached the final, but this time without Cruijff (who decided to retire from international football) and under the guidance of Ernst Happel rather than Michels. Out of the shadow of Cruijff, Rensenbrink found more room to showcase his own considerable talent, playing on the left-hand side of a front three alongside Johnny Rep and René van de Kerkhof. He scored a hat-trick in the opening game against Iran, another goal against Scotland which was goal number 1000 in World Cup history and a penalty in the 5–1 win over Austria. In the final against Argentina, the Netherlands yet again met the hosts. In an intense match, the Netherlands fell behind to a first-half Mario Kempes strike. After Dick Nanninga's equalizer 9 minutes from time, a long pass from the Dutch captain Ruud Krol in the last 30 seconds of normal time gave Rensenbrink a half-chance to score but his shot from a very narrow angle was deflected on to the post and bounced clear. Had he scored, it is almost certain that Holland would have won the World Cup with Rensenbrink being top goal scorer with Mario Kempes. Argentina scored twice in extra-time for a 3–1 victory and the Netherlands again had to settle for the runners-up spot.
Rensenbrink played some of the qualifiers for Euro 80, but after earning his 46th cap in 1979 (a 2–0 defeat by Poland in a qualifier for Euro 80), he retired from international football at the age of 32, having scored 14 times for his country. He along with Eusébio are the only players to score the most goals from a penalty spot in a tournament (4 in 1978).
He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was also named Anderlecht's greatest ever foreign player in 2008.
Personal life.
Rensenbrink was married and lived in Oostzaan. In the summer of 2015, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy three years earlier. He died on 24 January 2020. Belgian news sources reported that he had been diagnosed with a muscular disease in 2012 which led to his death.

= = = Harmonic series (mathematics) = = =
In mathematics, the harmonic series is the divergent infinite series:
Divergent means that as you add more terms the sum never stops getting bigger. It does not go towards a single finite value.
Infinite means that you can always add another term. There is no final term to the series.
Its name comes from the idea of harmonics in music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, etc., of the string's fundamental wavelength. Apart from the first term, every term of the series is the harmonic mean of the terms either side of it. The phrase "harmonic mean" also comes from music.
History.
The fact that the harmonic series diverges was first proven in the 14th century by Nicole Oresme, but was forgotten. Proofs were given in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jacob Bernoulli.
Harmonic sequences have been used by architects. In the Baroque period architects used them in the proportions of floor plans, elevations, and in the relationships between architectural details of churches and palaces.
Divergence.
There are several well-known proofs of the divergence of the harmonic series. A few of them are given below.
Comparison test.
One way to prove divergence is to compare the harmonic series with another divergent series, where each denominator is replaced with the next-largest power of two:
Each term of the harmonic series is greater than or equal to the corresponding term of the second series, and therefore the sum of the harmonic series must be greater than or equal to the sum of the second series. However, the sum of the second series is infinite:
It follows (by the comparison test) that the sum of the harmonic series must be infinite as well. More precisely, the comparison above proves that
for every positive integer formula_8.
This proof, proposed by Nicole Oresme in around 1350, is considered to be a high point of medieval mathematics. It is still a standard proof taught in mathematics classes today.
Integral test.
It is possible to prove that the harmonic series diverges by comparing its sum with an improper integral. Consider the arrangement of rectangles shown in the figure to the right. Each rectangle is 1 unit wide and formula_9 units high, so the total area of the infinite number of rectangles is the sum of the harmonic series:
The total area under the curve formula_11 from 1 to infinity is given by a divergent improper integral:
Since this area is entirely contained within the rectangles, the total area of the rectangles must be infinite as well. This proves that
The generalization of this argument is known as the integral test.
Rate of divergence.
The harmonic series diverges very slowly. For example, the sum of the first 1043 terms is less than 100. This is because the partial sums of the series have logarithmic growth. In particular,
where formula_15 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and formula_16 which approaches 0 as formula_8 goes to infinity. Leonhard Euler proved both this and also that the sum which includes only the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges also diverges, that is:
Partial sums.
The finite partial sums of the diverging harmonic series,
are called harmonic numbers.
The difference between formula_20 and formula_21 formula_22 converges to the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The difference between any two harmonic numbers is never an integer. No harmonic numbers are integers, except for formula_23.
Related series.
Alternating harmonic series.
The series
is known as the alternating harmonic series. This series converges by the alternating series test. In particular, the sum is equal to the natural logarithm of 2:
The alternating harmonic series, while conditionally convergent, is not absolutely convergent: if the terms in the series are systematically rearranged, in general the sum becomes different and, dependent on the rearrangement, possibly even infinite.
The alternating harmonic series formula is a special case of the Mercator series, the Taylor series for the natural logarithm.
A related series can be derived from the Taylor series for the arctangent:
This is known as the Leibniz series.
General harmonic series.
The general harmonic series is of the form
where formula_28 and formula_29 are real numbers, and formula_30 is not zero or a negative integer.
By the limit comparison test with the harmonic series, all general harmonic series also diverge.
p-series.
A generalization of the harmonic series is the formula_31-series (or hyperharmonic series), defined as
for any real number formula_31. When formula_34, the formula_31-series is the harmonic series, which diverges. Either the integral test or the Cauchy condensation test shows that the formula_31-series converges for all formula_37 (in which case it is called the over-harmonic series) and diverges for all formula_38. If formula_37 then the sum of the formula_31-series is formula_41, i.e., the Riemann zeta function evaluated at formula_31.
The problem of finding the sum for formula_43 is called the Basel problem; Leonhard Euler showed it is formula_44. The value of the sum for formula_45 is called Apéry's constant, since Roger Apéry proved that it is an irrational number.
ln-series.
Related to the formula_31-series is the ln-series, defined as
for any positive real number formula_31. This can be shown by the integral test to diverge for formula_38 but converge for all formula_37.
�-series.
For any convex, real-valued function formula_51 such that
the series
is convergent.
Random harmonic series.
The random harmonic series
where the formula_55 are independent, identically distributed random variables taking the values +1 and −1 with equal probability formula_2, is a well-known example in probability theory for a series of random variables that converges with probability 1. The fact of this convergence is an easy consequence of either the Kolmogorov three-series theorem or of the closely related Kolmogorov maximal inequality. Byron Schmuland of the University of Alberta further examined the properties of the random harmonic series, and showed that the convergent series is a random variable with some interesting properties. In particular, the probability density function of this random variable evaluated at +2 or at −2 takes on the value ..., differing from formula_57 by less than 10−42. Schmuland's paper explains why this probability is so close to, but not exactly, formula_57. The exact value of this probability is given by the infinite cosine product integral formula_59 divided by .
Depleted harmonic series.
The depleted harmonic series where all of the terms in which the digit 9 appears anywhere in the denominator are removed can be shown to converge and its value is less than 80. In fact, when all the terms containing any particular string of digits (in any base) are removed the series converges.
Applications.
The harmonic series can be counterintuitive. This is because it is a divergent series even though the terms of the series get smaller and go towards zero. The divergence of the harmonic series is the source of some paradoxes. 
Because the series gets arbitrarily large as formula_22 becomes larger, eventually this ratio must exceed 1, which implies that the worm reaches the end of the rubber band. However, the value of formula_22 at which this occurs must be extremely large: approximately formula_64, a number exceeding 1043 minutes (1037 years). Although the harmonic series does diverge, it does so very slowly.
Calculating the sum shows that the time required to get to the speed of light is only 97 seconds.

= = = White Christmas (movie) = = =
White Christmas is a 1954 American musical movie starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen. It was directed by Michael Curtiz. It was filmed in VistaVision and Technicolor. It has songs by Irving Berlin, including the title song, "White Christmas". This was a new version of the song sung by Crosby in the 1942 film "Holiday Inn".
The movie was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is notable for being the first to be released in VistaVision. This is a widescreen process developed by Paramount. It used twice the surface area of the then standard 35mm film. This large-area negative was used to yield finer-grained standard-sized 35mm prints.
The word "film" is sometimes used instead of "movie". They are the same thing.
Plot.
The movie starts on Christmas Eve, 1944, somewhere in Europe. It is World War II. Crosby and Kaye play two U.S. Army soldiers. Crosby plays Captain Bob Wallace and Kaye plays Private First Class Phil Davis. Bob is a Broadway entertainer, Phil wants to be a professional entertainer. They perform "White Christmas". Their commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly is being relieved of his command. He arrives for the end of the show and says goodbye.
After the performance everyone is forced to take cover from an aerial bombing. A bomb knocks over a Wwall. Bob is too busy shouting orders to notice. Phil pushes him out of the way and injurs his arm. Bob later visits Phil at a field hospital and thanks him for saving his life. Phil shows Bob a duet he wrote and asks to perform with him back in New York City. Feeling obligated by Phil's heroism, Bob agrees.
After the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers. They mount their newest hit musical titled "Playing Around". The same day they receive a letter from "Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy," their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.
They go to the club to watch the "Sisters" act. Phil notices that Bob likes Betty, played by Rosemary Clooney. Phil likes her sister Judy, played by Vera-Ellen. Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table. Phil dances with Judy. Phil and Judy hit it off. Bob and Betty do not get on. They have a minor argument about how Bob thinks that everyone has an "angle" in show business.
Judy and Betty are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Due to a disagreement with their landlord the girls have to leave. Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room on the train. They delay the sheriff by imitating the girls' and sing their song, "Sisters". Bob and Phil board later and Bob is extremely upset that they have to stay up all night in the club car on their way to NYC. They are joined by Betty and Judy, who thank them profusely for the tickets and convince them to come with them to Pine Tree.
When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there isn't any snow. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge. It is failing because there's no snow and no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical "Playing Around". They add in Betty and Judy to the rehearsals. Bob and Betty's relationship blooms and they spend a good deal of time together.
Bob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. Bob calls Ed Harrison an old army buddy. Ed is now a successful variety show host. They arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. Harrison suggests they put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis. Bob insists that it must have nothing to do with their business.
Nosy housekeeper Emma Allen has been listening, but she has only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea. She thinks that her boss will be seen as a pitiable figure on TV and tells Betty. Betty is shocked. The misunderstanding causes Betty to ignore a baffled Bob. While this is happening, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer.
After rehearsals are complete, Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony. Bob still doesn't know the real reason Betty left. He goes to New York for "The Ed Harrison Show". He tries to convince Betty to come back. Bob sees Betty's new act and tells her the truth about the engagement. He is called away by Ed Harrison before he finds out what is really bothering her.
Back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement. In the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve. Betty sees it on TV and realizes she was wrong. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show, but only tells Judy. The whole division comes into Pine Tree secretly. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of "The Old Man". Just as the following song ends, the snow starts to fall.
In the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another. So do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling. Bob, Betty, Phil and Judy perform "White Christmas". Everyone raises a glass, and toasts, "May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white."
Songs.
All songs were written by Irving Berlin. The centerpiece of the film is the title song. This was first used in "Holiday Inn" where it won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1942.
"Count Your Blessings" earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song.
The song "Snow" was originally written for "Call Me Madam" with the title "Free". The melody was kept but the lyrics were changed to be more appropriate for a Christmas movie.
The song "What Can You Do with a General?" was originally written for an un-produced project called "Stars on My Shoulders".
It was not possible to issue an "original soundtrack album" of the film, because Decca Records controlled the soundtrack rights, but Clooney was under exclusive contract with Columbia Records. Consequently, each company issued a separate "soundtrack recording": Decca issuing "Selections from Irving Berlin's White Christmas," while Columbia issued "Irving Berlin's White Christmas." On the former, the song "Sisters" and all of Clooney's vocal parts were recorded by Peggy Lee. On the latter, the song was sung by Rosemary Clooney and her own sister, Betty.
Crosby and Kaye recorded another Berlin song ("Santa Claus") for the opening WWII Christmas Eve show scene, but it was not used in the final film. Their recording of the song survives and can be found on the Bear Family Records 7-CD set called "Come On-A My House".
Casting.
"White Christmas" was intended to reunite Crosby and Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Crosby and Astaire had previously co-starred in "Holiday Inn" (1942) – where the song "White Christmas" first appeared – and "Blue Skies" (1946). Astaire declined the project after reading the script and asked to be released from his contract with Paramount. Crosby also left the project shortly thereafter, to spend more time with his sons after the death of his wife, Dixie Lee. Near the end of January 1953, Crosby returned to the project, and Donald O'Connor was signed to replace Astaire. Just before shooting was to begin, O'Connor had to drop out due to illness and was replaced by Danny Kaye, who asked for and received a salary of $200,000 and 10% of the gross. Financially, the film was a partnership between Crosby and Irving Berlin, who shared half the profits, and Paramount, which got the other half.
A scene from the film featuring Crosby and Kaye was broadcast the year after the film's release, on Christmas Day 1955, in the final episode of the NBC TV show "Colgate Comedy Hour" (1950–1955).
Production.
Berlin suggested a movie based on his song in 1948. Paramount put up the $2 million budget and only took 30% of the proceeds.
Principal photography took place between September and December 1953. The film was the first to be shot using Paramount's new VistaVision process, with color by Technicolor. It was one of the first to feature the Perspecta directional sound system at limited engagements.
Release and reception.
Bosley Crowther of "The New York Times" was not impressed: "...the use of VistaVision, which is another process of projecting on a wide, flat screen, has made it possible to endow "White Christmas" with a fine pictorial quality. The colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring—or very little—such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn't hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force."
"Variety" liked it: ""White Christmas" should be a natural at the box office, introducing as it does Paramount's new VistaVision system with such a hot combination as Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and an Irving Berlin score...Crosby and Kaye, along with VV, keep the entertainment going in this fancifully staged Robert Emmett Dolan production, clicking so well the teaming should call for a repeat...Certainly he "(Crosby)" has never had a more facile partner than Kaye against whom to bounce his misleading nonchalance."
"White Christmas" was enormously popular with audiences, earning $12 million in theatrical rentals – equal to $ today – making it the top moneymaker of 1954 by a wide margin and the highest-grossing musical film of all-time. Overall, the film grossed $30 million at the domestic box office.
There was a US theatrical re-release by Paramount in 1961.
Home video.
"White Christmas" was released in the US on VHS in 1986 and again in 1997. The first US DVD release was in 2000. It was re-released in 2009, with a Blu-ray in 2010. There was a US issue 4-disc "Diamond Anniversary Edition" in 2014. This collection contains a Blu-ray with extras, two DVDs with the film and extras, and a fourth disc of Christmas songs on CD. These songs are performed individually by Crosby, Clooney, and Kaye.
Stage adaptation.
A stage adaptation of the musical, titled "Irving Berlin's White Christmas" premiered in San Francisco in 2004 and has played in various venues in the US, such as Boston, Buffalo, Los Angeles, Detroit and Louisville.
The musical played a limited engagement on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre, from November 14, 2008 until January 4, 2009. The musical also toured the United Kingdom in 2006 - 2008. It headed to the Sunderland Empire in Sunderland from November 2010 to January 2011 after a successful earlier run in Manchester and has continued in various cities with a London West End run at the end of 2014.

= = = Masked tree frog = = =
The masked tree frog, New Granada cross-banded tree frog, Tarraco treefrog, or Central American smilisca ("Smilisca phaeota") is a frog that lives in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia. Scientists have seen it as high in the hills as 3300 meters above sea level.
This frog is called the masked tree frog because it has dark skin around its eyes so it looks like it is wearing a black mask. The black mask covers their eyes, which helps them hide from predators.
This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. The frog sleeps on top of large leaves, in ferns, or inside rolled-up leaves. Scientists think this frog eats insects and other animals without spines. This frog can change color. It can be tan during the day and turn green at night.
The male frog sits next to a small pool of rainwater and sings "wrauk" for the females. The females lay 2000 eggs at a time, which float on the surface of the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly before the rainwater dries up.

Makhnovshchina existed from 1918 to 1921. It was formed in an attempt to create a stateless anarchist society. This took place during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 to 1921. "Free soviets" and libertarian communes were set up and operated under the protection of Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army.
Makhnovshchina was established when Huliaipole was captured by Makhno's forces on 27 November 1918. Huliapole became the territory's de facto capital. The Ukrainian peasants refused to pay rent to the landowners and "...seized the estates and livestock of the pomeshchiks, kulaks, monasteries and State holdings: in so doing, they always set up local committees to manage these assets, with an eye to sharing them out among the various villages and communes."
Russian forces of the White movement under Anton Denikin occupied part of the region and formed a temporary government of Southern Russia in March 1920. In late March 1920, Denikin's forces were pushed back by Makno's forces and the Red Army. Makhnovshchina was disestablished in 1921 when Makhno and 77 of his men escaped. Remnants of the Black Army would continue to fight until late 1922.

= = = Yummy (Justin Bieber song) = = =
"Yummy" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album. The song is Bieber's first solo single to be released in three years. Upon its release, the song has received mostly mixed reception from critics: many praised its R&amp;B production but most dismissed its lyrics. Its official music video was directed by Bardia Zeinali, which premiered on January 4, 2020. 
Background and promotion.
On December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption "tomorrow". On the following day, he announced the single through a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station. The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering "all different stories". About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that he feels like "this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life".
Composition.
"Yummy" is a "straightforward R&amp;B number" that moves along on pop-trap beats. The song contains a "crisp bass line and plinking keyboards". Bieber sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his "signature falsetto" in the bridge. Bryan Rolli of "Forbes" magazine called the chorus "seductive", albeit "meaningless". The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife Hailey Bieber.
Critical reception.
"Yummy" received polarizing reviews from music critics, who complimented the "catchy" R&amp;B production. They also criticized the "asinine" lyrical content.
Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" said "Yummy" brings back "the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for", describing the chorus as "catchy". Bryan Rolli, a writer for "Forbes", said that Bieber "sings his heart out" on the song and noted although "the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them". Rolli concluded calling the song a "win, an inevitable chart smash" and opined that it is "sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour". Mikael Wood from the "Los Angeles Times" described the song as "a lithe little R&amp;B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic "Pony" and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin". He stated that "though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does" and added that the song "loses much of its flavor after only a few spins".
"NME"s Sam Moore complimented the song's R&amp;B production, who dismissed the lyrics. He termed as "failed expectations". He opined that the song's producers opted for "minimalism with their choice of instrumentation, melding airy keys with pop-trap beats with an evident view of creating something as universal as the likes of 'Hotline Bling' and Childish Gambino's 'Feels Like Summer'". Moore further wrote that Bieber's layered vocals and harmonies are "able to glide along rather effortlessly—it's just a shame he doesn't have more to say with them" and that Bieber's embrace of R&amp;B "isn't a complete turn-off". "Pitchfork"s Eric Torres criticized the song for being "shamelessly engineered for the truncated attention span of TikTok" and "a bloodless shell of an R&amp;B song crippled by asinine lyrics and a tired, syncopated backdrop". He further wrote that the song "plateaus as soon as it starts, never inching past the toddler-like repetition of 'yummy-yum' in its chorus". Brad Callas from "Complex" listed "Yummy" among the best new music of the week and said Bieber's "pivot back to R&amp;B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project, "Journals"". Callas further remarked that the "silky vocals" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, "Deja Vu".
Music video.
The music video for "Yummy" was directed by Bardia Zeinali, which premiered on January 4, 2020. In the video, it portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant, eating various colorful food items with the guests.

= = = Frame rate = = =
Frame rate is a way of describing video. It refers to the number of images, called frames, that are being shown every second. It is measured in frames per second, or FPS.
Early silent movies were shown at a frame rate between 16 and 24 frames per second. This went up to 20 and 26 FPS later. When movies with sound came out 24 FPS became the standard because it was in the middle of the frame rates theaters used.
Video games are usually played at a frame rate of 60 frames per second. This is because it is a very common refresh rate (display speed) for computer monitors. They also can run at 30 FPS, or even more, such as 144 FPS or 240 FPS, depending on what the monitor can handle. If the frame rate is higher than the refresh rate, not all of the frames can be shown. If two or more frames are displayed at the same time, it can cause problems like screen tearing.

= = = Screen tearing = = =
Screen tearing is a type of video error. It can happen when multiple video frames are displayed at a single time on a computer monitor. The frames will each be shown on different parts of the screen, and can leave horizontal lines if the pictures are different at the point.
Screen tearing can be stopped by synchronizing the frames that are put on the screen. Vertical synchronization, or VSync, is one popular way. Another way is FreeSync or G-Sync, but these options only work with certain GPUs and monitors.

Sidney is a city in the U.S. state of Nebraska. It is the county seat of Cheyenne County. The population was 6,410 at the 2020 census.
History.
The city was founded in 1867 by the Union Pacific railroad company. It grew up around the military base called Fort Sidney (also known as Sidney Barracks). The soldiers there were stationed to guard transcontinental railroad from potential Indian attacks. When the railroad reached Sidney, it was the end of a sub-division of the rail line and played host to a roundhouse, repair facilities, and a railroad hotel for passengers.
The city was named after Sidney Dillon. He was president of the Union Pacific Railroad at that time.
The town became the southern terminus of the Sidney Black Hills Stage Road in the late 1870s and 1880s.
Sidney has one of the Old West's Boot Hill cemeteries; many of those interred there were soldiers from the fort.

= = = Diet of Worms = = =
The Diet of Worms was a council of the Holy Roman Empire in the city of Worms. The council was held because of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. It lasted for five months in early 1521. The Emperor, Charles V led the council. Other councils (called Imperial Diets) were held in Worms in the years 829, 926, 1076, 1122, 1495, and 1545, but the most important Diet of Worms was in 1521.
Background.
In June 1520, Pope Leo X wrote the Papal bull Exsurge Domine ("Arise, O Lord"), in which he talked about 41 problems he saw in Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses and his other works. Because of this, the Holy Roman Emperor told Martin Luther to come to the diet. He promised that he would give Luther safe passage to and from it. The Diet started on 23 January 1521. Martin Luther was told that he had to either take back what he had said or defend it.
Events of the Diet.
Most of the important things in the Diet happened between 16-18 April. On 16 April, Martin Luther got to the city of Worms. He was told to come to the Diet at 4 p.m. on the 17th, and given a lawyer. After a day of arguing about his works, he was told that he was acting like a heretic. On the 18th of April, he went home. But Frederick III, Elector of Saxony thought that someone might kill him, so he faked a highway ambush and used this as a reason to hide Luther in one of his castles.
The Edict of Worms.
By 23 May 1521, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, King of Spain (Castile and Aragon), King of Germany, King of Italy, Lord of the Netherlands, and Titular Duke of Burgundy had had enough of all of this Martin Luther business, so he wrote:
After that, he ended the Diet of Worms.
However, because Luther was hidden in Wartburg Castle, nothing ever happened to him.

A dual in-line package is one way of making microchips and other integrated circuits. The circuit is put inside of a container made out of materials such as plastic or ceramic. All the wires of the circuit are connected to metal pins, and they stick out of the package on two sides. This way the circuit is able to be used from inside the package.
Things can also be put in a dual in-line package that are not integrated circuits. A DIP switch is one example of this, where there are switches on top of the package instead of a circuit inside.
