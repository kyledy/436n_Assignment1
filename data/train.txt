= = = Boston accent = = =
The Boston accent is a local accent of Eastern New England English. It is spoken specifically in the city of Boston, its suburbs, and much of eastern Massachusetts. Eastern New England English also traditionally includes New Hampshire and Maine. The accent originated with the Puritans who came to the area from East Anglia in the 17th century. It was also influenced by 19th and 20th century immigrants from Ireland. This resulted in the distinct r-dropping (locally called "wicked natural") dialect found in modern costal Massachusetts.
Non-rhoticity.
The traditional Boston accent is non-rhotic, particularly in the early 1900s. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers tend to use more of a rhotic accent than older speakers from the Boston region. The Boston accent is pronounced with a “broad A”. The letter "r" is dropped only in certain words like 'car' and 'hard'. For example, a person might “pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd.”
Lexicon.
Some words used in the Boston area are:

City ordinance 176874, adopted September 4, 2002, sets the design and what it means. Green stands for "the forests and our green City"; yellow for "agriculture and commerce"; blue for "our rivers". Portland is on the Willamette River near its joining with the Columbia River. City Ordinance 186794, adopted September 3, 2014, updated the proportions and the Pantone color specifications: White, PMS 279 (Blue); PMS 349 (Green); and PMS 1235 (Yellow).
The flag was designed in 1969 by a longtime Portland resident, graphic designer R. Douglas Lynch (1913–2009). The version of the flag adopted at that time included, over Lynch's objections, a dark blue canton containing the city seal in yellow and white; in 2002 Lynch and fellow members of the Portland Flag Association persuaded the city council to simplify the design to better reflect his original intent.

= = = Flash Airlines Flight 604 = = =
Flash Airlines Flight 604, a Boeing 737-300, was a flight from Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to Paris, France, via Cairo. On January 3, 2004 the plane crashed into the Red Sea just moments after take-off at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. All 135 passengers and 13 crew members on-board the plane died. The cause of the crash remains disputed, but it was suggested to be spatial disorientation by the Captain.
The crash remains Egypt's deadliest air-disaster, until the bombing of Kogalymavia Flight 9268, with 224 deaths. The crash is also the worst crash of a Boeing 737-300.
The flight took off at 04:44 Eastern European Time (0244 GMT) from runway 22R at the Egyptian resort en route to Paris via Cairo. After taking off, the aircraft should have climbed and initiated a left turn to follow the air corridor to Cairo designated by the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. The captain appeared surprised when the autopilot was engaged, which he immediately switched off again. The copilot warned the captain that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right, the captain said "OK come out".
The ailerons were briefly returned to neutral before being commanded to increase the bank to the right, likely by the captain in a state of surprise. The aircraft reached an altitude of 5,460 feet (1,660 m) with a 50-degree bank when the copilot exclaimed "Overbank" repeatedly when the bank angle kept increasing. The bank angle was 111 degrees right, while the pitch attitude was 43 degrees nose down at an altitude of 3,470 feet (1,060 m).
The observer on the flight deck, also a pilot, but a trainee on this 737 variant, shouted "Retard power, retard power, retard power", to get the captain to pull the throttles back so that the aircraft stopped gaining speed. Both throttles were moved to idle; the captain appeared to regain control of the airplane. However the speed increased, activating the overspeed warning.
At 04:45, the aircraft impacted the water about 8.2 nautical miles (15.2 km) south of the airport. The impact occurred while the aircraft was in a 24 degree right bank, 24 degree nose-down attitude, travelling at 416 knots (770 km/h, 478 mph,) and pulling 3.9g (38 m/22). All 148 passengers and crew were lost.
Most of the passengers aboard the flight were French tourists from the Paris metropolitan area. A provisional passenger list, dated January 5 January 2004, stated that twelve entire French families had boarded the flight.

= = = Jacques I, Prince of Monaco = = =
Jacques Goÿon, Count of Matignon ("Jacques François Léonor"; 21 November 1689 – 23 April 1751) was Count of Thorigny and Matignon. He was also the Prince of Monaco as Jacques I after his marriage to Princess Louis Hippolyte of Monaco. He also built the Hôtel Matignon.
Life.
Jacques was born in Normandy. His father was the Count of Matignon. Jacques became the Count of Matignon in 1675 when his father died. Jacques married Princess Louise Hippolyte Grimaldi of Monaco.
Issue.
The children of the couple were technically given the surname of "Goyon" after their father however they were sometimes also known under the surname of Grimaldi too.

Stefán Karl Stefánsson (; ; 10 July 1975 – 21 August 2018) was an Icelandic actor and singer. He was best known for playing antagonist Robbie Rotten on the children's television series "LazyTown".
Career.
Stefán Karl's career started in 1994. At the age of 19, he worked as a puppeteer for television. During his years as a puppeteer, he had also been studying at the Drama Academy of Iceland. However, he was not satisfied with how Iceland views their drama standards. He remembered that his principal at his high school said that "acting is not about making faces and changing your face". He did not agree with his high school principal.
Later, Stefán Karl had been invited by Magnús Scheving, an Icelandic gymnast, to portray one of the characters in the second "LazyTown" play. Scheving created the plays because he was concerned that Iceland's younger generation is not doing enough exercise. Stefán Karl explained that "[Scheving] wanted the kids to get healthier, so he created this musical called "LazyTown". He played Sportacus, the fitness fanatic, and I was Robbie Rotten, the guy who liked to stay indoors and sleep". After initial success with the musical, Nickelodeon eventually made a deal with the creators of "LazyTown" to air the first 40 episodes of "LazyTown" along with a special studio built in Iceland. During the first few years of "LazyTown" in the early 2000s, Stefán Karl initially knew no English, but soon became fluent.

On the same month, GoFundMe campaign was subsequently created by "LazyTown" head writer Mark Valenti to pay his living costs when he became too ill to work. The campaign was popularized by various YouTube users uploading parodies of Stefán Karl's work. This eventually made the songs "We Are Number One" and "The Mine Song" from "LazyTown" become Internet memes. In August 2017, Stefán Karl stated he was in remission. He clarified on his GoFundMe campaign that while his metastases had been removed after successful liver surgery in June 2017, he still had the disease and had refused further adjuvant therapy.
In March 2018, Stefán Karl was diagnosed with inoperable bile duct cancer, and said that he was undergoing chemotherapy to increase the length of his life. In April 2018, he announced that he personally chose to stop his chemotherapy, and then began to shut down all his social media accounts.

= = = Guiana Shield = = =
The Guiana Shield is a geographic region found in northeast South America. It is one of the three cratons of the South American Plate. It is a 1.7 billion-year-old Precambrian geological formation that forms part of the South American northern coast.
The higher elevations on the region are called the Guiana Highlands, which is where there are mesas or "table" mountains called "tepuis".
Names.
"Guiana" and "The Guianas" are often used as collective names for Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, and sometimes even includes the portions of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil which are on the Guiana Shield.
Geography.
The Guiana Shield is In six countries; they are, from west to east:
The Guiana Shield is roughly bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Orinoco river to the north and west, the Negro river (an important tributary of the Amazon river) to the southwest, and the Amazon river to the south.
Mountains.
The Guiana Highlands is formed by small plateaus and mountain ranges. The western part of the Highlands, mainly in Venezuela, is where are the higher mountains. From west to east, the mountains ranges and plateaus are:
The highest point in the Guiana Shield is Pico da Neblina () in Brazil at . Pico da Neblina is the highest summit of the larger "Serra do Imeri", a plateau on the Venezuela-Brazil border; it is also the highest mountain in Brazil.
Rivers and waterfalls.
Many rivers start on the Guiana Highlands and most of them flow to the north, into the Atlantic Ocean. Some of them are:
In the region there are some notable waterfalls such as the Angel Falls, high, in Venezuela, and the Kaieteur Falls, high, on the Potaro River in the Pacaraima Mountains of Guyana.
Climate.
As a whole, the Guiana Shield region has a tropical climate characterized by a relatively high mean annual temperature over at sea level. Because of the Guiana Shield is just north of the equator, its climate varies primarily according to elevation and the effects of the trade winds. The trade winds blow from the east and northeast, off of the Atlantic Ocean onto northeastern South America.
The heaviest rains usually occur between May and August, whereas the rainy season from December to January is shorter and less intense, with rains mostly along the coast. In areas where there is only one rainy season, the driest part of the year is January to March; in areas where there are two rainy seasons the driest months are March and October. However, even during most dry seasons, frequent storms provide adequate moisture to allow evergreen tropical moist forests to persist in most low elevation parts of the region.
The climate data for Santa Elena de Uairén weather station () in La Gran Sabana at an altitude of are:.
Plant and animal life.
Since the individual peaks in the Guiana Highlands have been isolated from each other for millions of years, many plants and animals have evolved in a different way on each mountain.
Many of the mountains are covered in permanent clouds and mist washing all the soil away, and leaving barren rock and water. Because of this many plants are carnivorous and feed on insects and small animals.
So far over 2,000 species of plants been found, and more than 50% are endemic to this region, meaning they are found only here, and many are only found on one peak.

Care should be taken, because the hornets may sting without warning. The pain from the sting may persist for a few days with swelling.

= = = Hotepsekhemwy = = =
Hotepsekhemwy was an early Egyptian king, the first ruler of the Second Dynasty. It is not known how long he ruled. The Turin King List has him ruling for 95 years. The Ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reports that the reign of "Boëthôs" lasted for 38 years. Egyptologists now believe Hotepsekhemwy ruled for either 25 or 29 years.
Name sources.
Hotepsekhemwy's name has been found at Saqqara, Giza, Badari and Abydos, on clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his successor Raneb.
The Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy may give clues to the politics of the time. The Egyptian word "Hotep" means "peaceful", "to be pleased", and also "conciliation" or "to be reconciled". So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as "the two powers are reconciled" or "pleasing in powers". This suggests a significant political meaning. "The two powers" could be Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth.
From the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the nebty name in the same way. The Horus name has a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also show, that the Horus name was used when becoming king.
Family.
The name of Hotepsekhemwy's wife is unknown. There could be a son, Perneb, who had the titles “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu”. The clay seals with Perneb's name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which belonged to two kings equally, Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, Raneb. It is not possible to know which was his father.
Identity.
Hotepsekhemwy is known from lists made at the time of Ramesses II. The name "Bedjau" is found on the Abydos king list, "Bedjatau" from Giza, "Netjer-Bau" from the Sakkara king list and the name "Bau-hetepju" is on the Turin King List. A similar name, "Bedjatau", is on a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. "Bedjatau" means "the foundryman". This is thought to be a misreading of the name "Hotepsekhemwy". The hieroglyphic signs used to write "Hotep" are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two "Sekhem"sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. This kind of misreading may have happened in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list copies this Old Kingdom name form of “Bedjatau”. The names "Netjerbau" and "Bau-hetepju" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.
Reign.
Little is known about Hotepsekhemwy's reign. Evidence shows he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife. During this time there were several kings who only ruled for a very short time, such as Horus "Bird" and Sneferka. Sneferka could be a name used by king Qaa for a short time. The tomb of king Qaa was robbed at the end of First dynasty, and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The robbing of the cemetery and the conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. The kings Sneferka and Horus “Bird” were left out of later king lists, perhaps because their struggles for the Egyptian throne led to the collapse of the first dynasty.
A new royal residence called "Horus the shining star" built for Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near Buto for the god "Netjer-Achty" and founded the "Chapel of the White Crown". The white crown, the hedjet, is a symbol of Upper Egypt. This is a clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy's dynasty, and shows a likely source of political power. There is no mention of a Sed festival,which shows that Hotepsekhemwy cannot have ruled longer than 30 years. The Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary for a reign of 30 years.
The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reported that during his reign, "a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished". Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC – over two thousand years later – the story may be based on fact, as the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active.
Tomb.
The location of Hotepsekhemwy's tomb is unknown. Some Egyptologists believe it could be the giant underground "Gallery Tomb B" beneath the funeral passage of the Unas-necropolis at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries. Others think that "Gallery Tomb B" is the burial site of king Raneb. Several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there.

= = = Bullet cluster = = =
The Bullet cluster (1E 0657-558) consists of two colliding clusters of galaxies. Strictly speaking, the name "Bullet cluster" refers to the smaller subcluster, moving away from the larger one. It is at a co-moving radial distance of 1.141 x 109 parsecs (3.7 billion light-years).
Gravitational lensing studies of the Bullet cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter. However, this interpretation of the gravitational lensing results is disputed. Observations of other galaxy cluster collisions, such as MACS J0025.4-1222, are similarly claimed to support the existence of dark matter.
Mordehai Milgrom, the original proposer of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), has posted on-line a rebuttal of claims that the Bullet Cluster proves the existence of dark matter. Milgrom claims that MOND correctly accounts for the dynamics of galaxies outside of galaxy clusters, and even in clusters such as the Bullet Cluster it removes the need for most dark matter, leaving only a factor of two which Milgrom expects to be simply unseen ordinary matter (non-luminous baryonic matter) rather than cold dark matter. Without MOND, or some similar theory, the matter discrepancy in galaxy clusters is a factor of 10, i.e. MOND reduces this discrepancy five-fold to a factor of 2.

= = = Skyros = = =
Skyros is an island of the east coast of Greece. It is the southernmost island of the Sporades, an archipelago in the Aegean Sea. Around the 2nd millennium BC and slightly later, the island was known as "The Island of the Magnetes". Later it was called "Pelasgia" and "Dolopia". Finally it got the name Skyros. At it is the largest of the Sporades. The island has a population of about 3,000 (in 2011). The Hellenic Air Force has a major base in Skyros, because of the island's strategic location in the middle of the Aegean. It is a popular tourist location. Skyros is the resting place of Rupert Brooke, the British poet.
In Skyros lives a small horse whose height is about 90 to 110 centimeters. This horse is a rare breed and does not exist anywhere else in the world. This fact makes it a valuable animal species and is of great scientific interest. It is a petite and fine-boned animal. His head is somewhat thick, but with large intelligent eyes and large nostrils. The neck is very strong and thick in proportion to the shoulder blades and sternum, which are narrow and sharp. The head looks like a single piece, with the very muscular neck, thick and triangular where it meets the head. His mane is long and rich with a color always darker than the skin and mixed with silver hairs. 

= = = Garden of the Sanhedrin Tombs = = =
The Tombs of the Sanhedrin is a series of tombs in Jerusalem, Israel. The tombs are cut into the rock underground. It was named after the Sanhedrin - courts of judges that were chosen in every city of ancient Israel.
History.
The cave was cleared in 1903 by the American archaeologist G. A. Burton. In 1950, archaeologist Yotam Julius Rothschild finished excavating the cave (clearing it out completely, so he could see what was inside). In the cave was a coffin with the name "Isaac" written on it. The coffin was taken to France, and today it is in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
Many burial caves were found in the Sanhedrin caves. The whole area is part of the necropolis, a very big, underground cemetery used during the Second Temple period in Jerusalem. There are a few reasons why this area in Jerusalem has so many burial caves. First, the area was used for stone quarrying - taking huge pieces of stone out of the ground to use them to build things. This left large caves. Also, at the time, rich people in Jerusalem liked the idea of burial caves. This made the idea of a necropolis easier and popular.

"The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise" is a comedy routine. It was first shown during episode 22 of the first season of "Saturday Night Live" on May 29, 1976. The routine is twelve minutes long. It was written by Michael O'Donoghue consulting with actor John Belushi. They included a realistic model of the "USS Enterprise" bridge from the TV show "Star Trek". Dress rehearsal was hard. The writer was not sure if Belushi would be able to do a good parody of William Shatner's performance as Captain Kirk. The routine was a success. O'Donoghue immediately congratulated Belushi after his performance.
The sketch became an instant classic hit among "Star Trek" fans and science fiction fans. The 1977 book "Saturday Night Live" included a copy of a note from "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry where he called the comedic bit "delicious". The routine was released on a 1985 "Saturday Night Live" videotape that combined "The Best of John Belushi". It was released again with the same title in DVD format in 2011.
Reviews.
In his book "Metapop", author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit one of the most famous scenes from "Saturday Night Live". The "Chicago Sun-Times" called it a really intelligent parody of "Star Trek". "Huffpost TV" called it one of "the most famous parodies" of "Star Trek". "The A.V. Club" said the sketch was really well-done comedy.
"The New Yorker" movie critic Anthony Lane wrote that Belushi did a perfect acting job. "The Hollywood Reporter" interviewed Tom Hanks and Elliott Gould in 2015. Gould called the sketch a favorite. Hanks said it was one of the top five best of all time. "Rolling Stone" ranked every "Saturday Night Live" cast member by talent in 2015, and John Belushi was placed at number one. "Rolling Stone" said the Captain Kirk parody was one of Belushi's best.

In 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 the Unified Modeling Language was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard.
There are different types of diagrams, which serve different purposes:

= = = The Land of Gorch = = =
The Land of Gorch is a series of stories in episodes from the first season of the comedy television show "Saturday Night Live". It was special because it included Jim Henson's Muppets. Before he worked on "Sesame Street", Henson had made his puppet characters for a more adult audience, including his show "Sam and Friends". His characters were regular appearances on the late-night-comedy television shows including "The Ed Sullivan Show". After "Sesame Street", Henson was afraid that he would only be able to get work in the future on children's television series. His friend and advisor Bernie Brillstein, who also represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him move over from his prior work to "Saturday Night Live". 
The idea behind "The Land of Gorch" was that it had Muppet characters in a far-away place, who were members of a royal family. They behaved rudely, with many references to drug abuse, sex, and drinking alcohol. Characters included King Ploobis and Queen Peutra and children, and servants Scred and Vazh. These characters often spoke to their wise prophet Mighty Favog for advice.
The staff of "Saturday Night Live" disagreed with Henson's ideas. Writers Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches involving "The Land of Gorch". Henson felt they were trying to write for situational comedy and were not keeping true to his own ideas. Frank Oz agreed in the end that the match was not perfect between "Saturday Night Live" and "The Land of Gorch", and was thankful that by the end of the year he and Henson were able to move on to "The Muppet Show".
Influence and reviews.
"The Land of Gorch" influenced many later creations by Jim Henson. His feature film "The Dark Crystal" used both puppetry techniques and story ideas from the sketches. The Jim Henson Company television show "Dinosaurs" later contained similar story ideas previously seen in "The Land of Gorch", including a plot-line about environmentalism. 
Commentators talking about "The Land of Gorch" agreed that the reception was bad — "The A.V. Club" wrote that it became an open joke between the staff that no one wanted to continue having the sketches on "Saturday Night Live". "San Francisco Chronicle" called the characters the opposite of Kermit the Frog, and compared them to trolls. "DVD Talk" called the feature the worst mistake made in the first season of the "Saturday Night Live". "Vogue" described the characters as early versions of Muppets and the world they inhabited as quite dark. Academic Michael J. Bernsten wrote in his essay "The Muppetry of Nightmares" that the idea failed because the characters were not funny and did not have strong values.

= = = Plant hormone = = =
Plant hormones (or Phytohormones) are chemicals that regulate plant growth. In the UK they are called 'plant growth substances'. The best known plant hormone is auxin.
Plant hormones are signal molecules produced within the plant. They occur in extremely low concentrations. Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells. Hormones also govern the formation of flowers, stems, leaves, the shedding of leaves, and the development and ripening of fruit.
Plants, unlike animals, lack glands that produce and secrete hormones. Individual cells can produce hormones. They affect which tissues grow upward and which grow downward, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, plant longevity, and even plant death. Hormones are vital to plant growth, and, lacking them, plants would be mostly a mass of undifferentiated cells. So they are also known as growth factors or growth hormones.
Phytohormones are found not only in higher plants, but in algae too, with similar functions. They also occur in fungi and bacteria, where they may be used to induce beneficial reactions in host plants.

= = = Auxin = = =
Auxins are a class of plant hormones (or plant growth substances) with some morphogen-like characteristics. Auxins have a main role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in the plant's life cycle. they are essential for plant body development. 
Auxins and their role in plant growth were first described by the Dutch scientist Frits Warmolt Went. Kenneth V. Thimann isolated auxin and found its chemical structure to be indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, "Phytohormones", in 1937.
There are synthetic auxins, and in big doses they can be used as herbicides. Agent Orange is a mixture of synthetic auxins.

= = = Release (music) = = =
In the music industry, a release usually is a creative output from an artist available for sale or distribution. It is a broad term covering the many different forms music can be released in. Music can be released as singles, extended plays or as albums. A popular medium for releases is the Compact Disc (CD).
Musical performers often self-release (self-publish) their recordings without the involvement of an established record label. Some artists or groups who enjoy local or small scale popularity have started their own labels in order to release their music. Others simply sell the music directly to customers. One example is when it is sold at their live concerts. With the growth of the Internet, many musical acts have sold their recordings over the Internet without a record label. Unlike self-publishing a novel, which usually means that publishers did not want to publish it, even well-known musicians will choose to self-release recordings. Music managers are increasingly getting involved in music releases.
The word can also mean the event at which an album or single is first offered for sale. A release is sometimes called an album launch, or single launch.

In typography, a typeface is a family of fonts. Every glyph in a typeface shares certain design features. Typefaces have names, such as "Times New Roman", "Garamond", "Baskerville".
Every font of a typeface has specific details (such as size and weight) and is used in a particular way. The reason for having different fonts is to give the designer or printer choices which suit various needs. The most basic of all needs is to have the text legible and readable.
There are many versions of typefaces which are out of copyright. "ITC Garamond" is a different typeface from "Adobe Garamond" or "Monotype Garamond". These are all versions of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century. There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.
The art and craft of designing typefaces is called "type design". In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called "font developers" or "font designers".
Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as map-making or astrology and mathematics.
A very widely used typeface is "Times New Roman". This is a serif typeface commissioned by the British newspaper "The Times" in 1931. This typeface was later adapted for use in book printing, and again for use as a computer face. There are now many different versions of this typeface.

= = = Hinglish = = =
Hinglish (�������) is a language that combines words from the English language with those of South Asia. The name Hinglish itself is a portmanteau of "Hindi" and "English". It is spoken on the Indian subcontinent and the United Kingdom. It borrows words from other languages such as Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi. At first it was spoken only by what Indians refer to as "ABCDs" (American-Born Confused Desi). Now it is spoken by about 350 million speakers. It is heard on television and in advertisements in India. Coca-Cola's ad in Hinglish is "Life ho to aisi" (Life should be like this). Pepsi's ad is "Yeh Dil Maange More" (the heart wants more). Domino's Pizza asks "Hungry kya?" (Are you hungry?). It has become a hybrid language many Indians speak naturally and without giving it any thought. 
The first book written in Hinglish, "All we need is Love", is by Richa Devesar. It was published in March of 2015.

[...] It's been a long time since I've actually done anything new, but for me, it's as a person. I mean, I've spent a whole lot of time trying to figure out who I am, and I think everybody goes through that."

= = = Bluehenge = = =
Bluestonehenge or Bluehenge (also known as West Amesbury Henge) is a prehistoric henge and stone circle monument.
It was discovered by the Stonehenge Riverside Project about south-east of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England. All that remains of the site is the ditch of the henge and a series of stone settings, none of which is visible above ground.
Excavation revealed two flint chisel arrowheads in a style commonly used during 3400-2500 BC. The stones have been put up in that period. It is estimated that there may have been as many as 27 stones in a circle 33 feet (10 m) wide.
The site was excavated in August 2008 and again in August 2009. It is considered an important find by archaeologists.
The name "Bluestonehenge" is from the small stone chips found in some of the stone settings. These bluestones are also found in Stonehenge and consist of a wide range of rock types originally from Pembrokeshire West Wales, some away. Archaeologists think any bluestones in the circle may have been removed around 2500 BC and used at Stonehenge, which had major rebuilding at about that time.
The stone circle settings were surrounded by a henge, comprising an ditch and outer bank which appears to date from approximately 2400 BC.

Gleipnir was made from six things: 
This was probably used to explain why all of those things are impossible.
The gods lured Fenrir to the island of Lyngvi. They challenged him to be bound by Gleipnir. To show Fenrir it was no trick, Týr put his hand in Fenrir's mouth. When he could not break Gleipnir's grip on him and they refused to let him out, Fenrir naturally bit off Týr's hand. Fenrir was to remain bound by Gleipnir until Ragnarök (the final great battle of the gods).

= = = End zone = = =
The end zone refers to the scoring area on the field, according to gridiron-based codes of football. It is the area between the end line and goal line bounded by the sidelines. There are two end zones. Each one is on an opposite side of the field. It is bordered on all sides by a white line indicating its beginning and end points. Usually padded orange square markers are placed at each of the four corners as a visual aid. Canadian rule books use the terms "goal area" and "dead line" instead of "end zone" and "end line" respectively. But the latter terms are the more common in Canadian English. In American football the end zone is 10 yards deep. Canadian football end zones are 20 yards; 10 yards deeper than those in American football. Sports like association football and ice hockey require the puck or ball to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score. Canadian and American football merely need the nose of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line.

They spend a good part of the day resting, noisily arguing among themselves. Like other macaws, in recent years there has been a decline in its numbers due to habitat loss. They are hunted for food, feathers or are illegally captured for the parrot trade.

Dither fish are aquarium fish used by cichlid owners to make some species of cichlids less afraid.

The technique is based on the ability of cichlids in an aquarium to use the behaviour of other fish species as a sign that the place they are in is safe. Good dither fish are usually schooling species, such as some "Danio" species, barbs and some tetra species.

The Burning of Parliament was a great fire in London on 16 October 1834. The Palace of Westminster, the medieval royal palace used as the home of the British parliament, was largely destroyed. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks. They had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner. They were thrown in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber. The fire smoldered under the floor for most of the day. The senile housekeeper and a careless Clerk of Works ignored all the warning signs of the pending disaster. This led the Prime Minister to call it "one of the greatest instances of stupidity upon record". 
The fire spread rapidly throughout the buildings. It became the worst fire to occur in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of the Second World War. the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted for most of the night. The House of Lords and the House of Commons were destroyed along with most of their libraries, art collections and records.

= = = Presumption of innocence = = =
The presumption of innocence, is sometimes referred to by the Latin expression Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat (the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies). It is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. In many nations, presumption of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial. It is also regarded as an international human right under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11. and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 14. This places the burden of proof on the prosecution. They have to collect and present enough compelling evidence to convince the trier of fact (a jury or judge) that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused is to be ted. Under Justinian Codes and English Common law, the accused is presumed innocent in criminal proceedings. In civil proceedings (like breach of contract) both sides must issue proof. Under Anglo-American Common Law, the accused is always presumed innocent in all types of proceedings. Proof is always the of the accuser. Sharia law, also called Islamic Law, is the third most common type of law in the world. It also has a presumption of innocence.

"Hold Me" is a 1984 recording of a song performed as a duet by Teddy Pendergrass and Whitney Houston. The ballad is on both Teddy Pendergrass' 1984 album "Love Language", from which it was released as a single, and Whitney Houston's 1985 self-titled debut album.
The original arrangement of the song, titled as "In Your Arms", written by Linda Creed &amp; Michael Masser, is on Diana Ross's 1982 album "Silk Electric", under the name "In Your Arms".

= = = Greatest Love of All = = =
"The Greatest Love of All" is a song written by Michael Masser and Linda Creed and originally recorded by George Benson for the 1977 Muhammad Ali biopic "The Greatest". (A live version by Benson appears on 1978's Weekend in L.A.). The song was also recorded in 1979 by Shirley Bassey, for her album "The Magic Is You".
The song was further popularized by Whitney Houston under the title "Greatest Love of All". The song was recorded by the American recording artist for her debut album, self-titled "Whitney Houston", which was released in February 1985, by Arista Records.
Creed wrote the lyrics in the midst of her struggle with breast cancer. The words describe her feelings about coping with great challenges that one must face in life, being strong during those challenges whether you succeed or fail, and passing that strength on to children to carry with them into their adult lives. Creed eventually succumbed to the disease in April 1986 at the age of 37; at the time her song was an international hit by Houston.
The song became a major hit, topping the charts in Australia, Canada and the US, while reaching the top 20 in most countries, including Italy, Sweden and UK. It remains her third biggest US hit, after "I Will Always Love You" and "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)". All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.
Whitney Houston version.
Clive Davis, founder of Houston's label Arista Records, was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, "Whitney Houston", but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the B-side to the single "You Give Good Love", a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song was eventually released as a single in its own right. The song, released on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in May of that year.
Houston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album.

= = = Legal burden of proof = = =
The burden of proof () is a level of proof that a party seeking to prove a fact must reach before it is accepted in a court of law. 
In a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecution. A defendant is not required to prove his or her innocence. The standard the prosecution must reach is proof of their version of the facts beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil trial the burden of proof is on the one bringing the case to court, called the plaintiff. In a civil trial the burden of proof is on the plaintiff. The standard that must be met is that the "preponderance of the evidence" (weight of the evidence) is enough to prove their case. 
Affirmative defense.
If a defendant in a civil or criminal case wants to provide an alternative set of facts to those provided by the prosecution or the plaintiff, this is called an "affirmative defense". This shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to prove his or her version of the facts. The defendant would seek to excuse or justify his or her actions that brought the lawsuit. Common affirmative defenses include entrapment, Self-defense, unclean hands, insanity, and the statute of limitations.
Preponderance of the evidence.
Preponderance of the evidence, also known as the "balance of probabilities" is the standard required in most civil cases. It is also used in family court for determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act.
The standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. Lord Denning, in "Miller v. Minister of Pensions", described it simply as "more probable than not." Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the United States. This is a far lower burden than "beyond a reasonable doubt," the threshold a prosecutor must meet in criminal trials.
Beyond a reasonable doubt.
This is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in common law countries. It usually only applies in criminal proceedings. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence (or lack of evidence) in a case, then the level of proof has not been met. If the jury, or judge in a bench trial, has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant is guilty.

Unlike Sunnis, Shias, and Ibadis, non-denominational Muslims are not affiliated with any school of thought (madhhab).
While the majority of the population in the Middle East identify as either Sunni or Shi'a, a significant number of Muslims identify as non-denominational. According to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center, Muslims who do not identify with a sect and identify as "just Muslim" make up a majority of the Muslims in eight countries: Kazakhstan (74%), Albania (65%), Kyrgyzstan (64%), Kosovo (58%), Indonesia (56%), Mali (55%), Bosnia and Herzegovina (54%), Uzbekistan (54%), and a plurality in four countries: Azerbaijan (45%), Russia (45%), Nigeria (42%), and Cameroon (40%). They are found primarily in Central Asia. Kazakhstan has the largest proportion of Muslims who do not identify with a sect, who constitute about 74% of the Muslim population. According to "WorldAtlas", 30% of Moroccans are non-denominational Muslims, while two-thirds belong to the Sunni denomination. Southeastern Europe also has a large number of Muslims who do not identify with a sect.

= = = Public good = = =
In Economics, a public good is a kind of common good. Public goods have two main properties:
Examples for public goods are fresh air, knowledge, street lighting, or a fireworks display.
Public goods are an example of market failure: If all actors maximize their gain, this does not produce an efficient solution. 
It is obvious that because the goods are non-excludable, it means that a producer sees no benefit in producing or providing the good on the market, this is because it is impossible to make a profit from it as people who have not paid for the good. For this reason, the government may intervene to provide it. There are relatively few examples of "purely" public goods, however some examples are:
The reason that the government feels the need to provide these goods is because the Marginal Social Benefit is greater than the Marginal Private Benefit, and so because there are positive externalities in consumption, it will always be under consumed in the market mechanism,

= = = Corona = = =
A corona is an aura of plasma which surrounds the sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse. It is also observable with a device called a coronagraph. The word "corona" is a Latin word meaning "crown", from the Ancient Greek ������ (korōnē, “garland, wreath”).
The Sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor from 150 to 450) than the visible surface of the Sun. The photosphere's average temperature is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona's one to three million kelvin. The corona is 10−12 times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow chromosphere. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being blown away by the open magnetic flux generating the solar wind.

= = = Ex post facto law = = =
An "ex post facto" law (Latin for "after the fact" or "from after the action") is a law that changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed before the law went into effect. In criminal law, an "ex post facto" law may criminalize actions that were legal at the time they were committed, or may make a crime worse by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed. 
In criminal law.
It may make the punishment prescribed for a crime, more severe. It may also add new penalties or it may extend a sentence. It may change the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. , a form of "ex post facto" law, commonly called an "amnesty law", may certain acts. A pardon has a similar effect in a specific case. Other legal changes may lessen or eliminate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) ly. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term in mitius.
US Constitution.
The United States Constitution s "ex post facto" laws. Two clauses in the constitution prohibit "ex post facto". Article 1 Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states: 'No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed,'. Section 10 says: 'No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law. . .'
In civil law.
"Ex post facto" laws relate only to criminal laws passed by legislations. It does not apply to civil laws "that affect private rights adversely." In 2003 the US Supreme court noted the difference between civil and penal laws. In the case of Smith v. Doe, the court questioned the constitutionality of the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act's retroactive requirements. Alaska's Megan's Law was applied to sex offenders before the law went into effect. It required offenders to register with the local police. It also required public notification via the Internet. The court made a legal precedent in deciding the intent of the law was civil and non-punitive. That it was to protect the public saftey by "protecting the public from sex offenders."
Europe.
The European Parliament prohibits "ex post facto" legislation by all member nations. They determined ""Ex post facto" legislation may also violate citizens’ right to effective legal redress and a fair trial..."
In English law, "ex post facto" laws are very rare. One example was the War Crimes Act 1991 by the Parliament of England. It allowed British citizens to be put on trial for war crimes that took place during World War II.

= = = Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire = = =
Between 1519 and 1521, Spanish conquistadors, led by Hernán Cortés, overthrew the Aztec Empire. This event is called the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Cortés helped old enemies of the Aztecs defeat them in one of the most important events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas.
The Spanish conquest was devastating to the Aztec people. By 1680, 94% of the Aztec population had died (due to diseases and viruses). 
End of the Empire.
In 1515, two of the states in the Aztec Empire rebelled. This was nothing new for the Aztecs. However, this time, the Tlaxcala and Huexotzingo rebels beat the Aztec military.
Then, in April 1519, Spanish conquistadors, led by Cortés, arrived on the coast of Mexico. In August they marched to Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. At first, Montezuma II, the Aztecs' ruler, invited the Spanish into Tenochtitlan, and things were friendly. Even when the Spanish made Montezuma II a prisoner, the Aztecs stayed friendly.
However, soon, while Cortés was away, Spanish soldiers attacked and killed many Aztecs during a festival. When Cortés got back, he got Montezuma II to tell the Aztecs to stop fighting the conquistadors. By this time, though, the Aztecs had made Montezuma II's brother, Cuauthemoc, the king. Nobody did what Montezuma II said. They kept fighting the conquistadors, and they killed two out of every three Spanish soldiers. In July 1520 the Spanish survivors fled to Tlaxcala, where enemies of the Aztecs protected them.
Ten months later, Cortés came back to Tenochtitlan with more Spanish soldiers but mostly Tlaxcaltecas and other indigenous enemies of the Aztecs. They started a siege of Tenochtitlan, so that no food or supplies could get in. After 91 days, without any food, and with disease throughout the city, Cuauhtemoc finally surrendered to the Spanish on August 13, 1521. The Spanish destroyed Tenochtitlan. They started a Spanish colony that they named New Spain. The Aztec Empire had ended.
Weapons.
There were many different reasons why the Spanish were able to take over the Aztec Empire.
Different weapons were used through the battle to help Cortes overrule the aztecs.
First, their weapons and armor were better than the Aztecs'. Aztec warriors had only cotton armour and shields made of wood or reeds to protect them. The Spanish had metal armor and shields.
For weapons, Aztec warriors had a few choices:
None of these weapons could compare to the conquistadors' guns and steel swords. Their horses and war dogs gave them even more of an advantage against the Aztecs.
Religion.
As early as 1528, reports have said that Montezuma II thought Hernán Cortés was the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. Aztec legends said that Quetzalcoatl would return as a man, and Cortés had arrived on Quetzalcoatl's birthday. Aztec writings from the time say that when Montezuma II greeted Cortés, he gave an abdication speech, giving up the Aztec throne to "Quetzalcoatl-Cortés":
As historian David Carrasco explains: Motecuhzoma II is welcoming "Quetzalcoatl-Cortes ... back to his city in order to reoccupy the throne which has been guarded by Montezuma and the other [kings] ... The ancient prophecy has been fulfilled and the returning lord is invited to occupy his throne and visit the palace. There could hardly be a clearer statement of returning the sovereignty to the original king."
Other causes.
Some historians say that the Spanish conquistadors were not the only reason the Aztec Empire fell apart. By 1519, the Empire had other problems that made it easier for Spain to take it over. For example:
Cortes wanted to conquer the aztecs for gold glory and god. 
Because of these things, many people in the Aztec Empire were unhappy. Some of them helped the Spanish conquistadors take over the Empire. Some historians, like Brian Fagan and Nadia Durrani, say that the Empire would have fallen apart even if the Spanish had never come. However, because so many people had died of smallpox, there were also not enough people left to fight against the conquistadors when they did come.
After the Empire.
Under Spanish control, the Aztec Empire did not exist any more. The Spanish tried to change the Aztecs into Catholics and make them act like Spanish people. They made it easier to change from Aztec rule to Spanish rule by letting many Aztec nobles become Spanish nobles.
The conquistadors rewarded people who had helped them defeat the Aztecs. Many received an Encomienda, a village full of Aztecs who were forced to work for them. This was not much different from what many serfs had done during the Aztec Empire. However, workers were badly abused, and many died. Because of this, a Spanish bishop named Bartolomé de las Casas suggested using African slaves to work in New Spain instead. Later, when he saw how much worse African slaves were treated, las Casas changed his mind about this.
By 1680, 94% of the Aztec population had died. This happened for a few reasons:
After taking over the Aztec Empire, the Spanish conquistadors moved on to take over other parts of Mesoamerica. During the same 160 years from 1520 to 1680 between 85% and 95% of Mesoamerica's native population died.

= = = Stuxnet = = =
Stuxnet is cyber weapon and computer worm. It was used to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program with what would seem like a long series of unfortunate accidents. It was first released in 2006. It became known only after the release of the second version. In 2010, an error in the code led the virus to spread outside the test labs and infect computers around the world.
Both the United States and Israel have been accused of developing and releasing Stuxnet. In 2012 the US confirmed that it developed Stuxnet with Israel.
Stuxnet targets PLCs. They control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Stuxnet works by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks. It then looks for Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.
Stuxnet is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected USB flash drive. The worm then spreads across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. If it doesn't find a target, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer.
Stuxnet is special for different reasons:
Even though it targeted PLCs only very few were infected. The software is written to infect a specific set of PLC, with well-defined modules. In the case of a personal computer, it will infect any computer running the right software.

= = = White Ship = = =
The White Ship () was a historic ship that sank in the English Channel. It went down near the Normandy coast off Barfleur, on 25 November 1120. Only two of those aboard survived. Those who drowned included William Adelin, the only surviving legitimate son and heir of King Henry I of England. William Adelin's death led to a succession crisis and a chain of events that changed the history of England. 
Shipwreck.
The "White Ship" was a new ship captained by Thomas FitzStephen. His father Stephen FitzAirard had been captain of the ship "Mora" for William the Conqueror when he invaded England in 1066. FitzStephen offered his ship to Henry I of England to use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already made other plans, but allowed many members of his royal court to take the "White Ship." This included his only son, William Adelin. It also included his illegitimate son Richard of Lincoln, his illegitimate daughter Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche and many other nobles. According to the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had left before the ship sailed due to the excessive drinking going on.
The ship's captain, Thomas FitzStephen, was ordered by the revelers to catch up to and pass the king's ship which had already sailed. The "White Ship" was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials. This made the captain and crew certain they could reach England first. But when the ship left in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock called "Quillebœuf" and the ship quickly sank. William Adelin got into a small boat and could have survived but he turned back to try to save his half-sister, Matilda (Countess of Perche), when he heard her cries for help. His boat filled with water when others tried to get in to save themselves, and William drowned along with them. According to Orderic Vitalis only two survived by clinging to the rock all night. One was a butcher from Rouen, the second was Geoffrey de l'Aigle. The chronicler further claimed that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the King.
One legend says that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it in the customary manner.
Descent into anarchy.
A direct result of William Adelin's death was the period known as the Anarchy. The "White Ship" disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child, a second daughter named Matilda. Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions, a woman had never ruled in England in her own right. Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou. He was a traditional enemy of England's Norman nobles. Upon Henry's death in 1135, the English barons were not sure they wanted Matilda as queen Regnant. 
One of Henry I's male relatives, Stephen of Blois, the king's nephew by his sister Adela, usurped Matilda as well as his older brothers William and Theobald to become king. Stephen had allegedly planned to travel on the "White Ship" but had left just before it sailed; Orderic Vitalis attributes this to a sudden bout of diarrhoea.
After Henry I's death, Matilda and her husband Geoffrey of Anjou, the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, started a long and devastating war against Stephen and his allies for control of the English throne. The period called the Anarchy lasted from 1135 to 1153 with devastating effect, especially in southern England.
A historian who lived about that time William of Malmesbury wrote: 

= = = Boat positions = = =
The front of a boat is called the bow, while the rear of a boat is called the stern. When looking towards the bow (while on the boat), the left-hand side of the boat is the port side. Starboard is the corresponding word for the right side of a boat.
Parts of a Boat: Boating Terminology.
Port and starboard are nautical terms for left and right, respectively. Port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel, facing forward. Starboard is the right-hand side, facing forward. Since port and starboard never change, they are clear references that do not depend on which way the observer is facing.
History.
The term "starboard" comes from the Old English "steorbord", meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had rudders on their center-lines, they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship. Because more people are right-handed it was placed on the right-hand side. The term is similar to the Old Norse "stýri" (rudder) and "borð" (side of a ship). Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat, it would tie up at wharf on the other side. For this reason the left side was called "port". 
Formerly "larboard" was used instead of "port". This is from Middle English "ladebord" and the term "lade" is related to the modern "load". "Larboard" sounded very similar to "starboard" and in 1844 the Royal Navy ordered that "port" be used instead. "Larboard" continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers. In Old English the word was "bæcbord", which is used in other European languages, for example as the German "backbord" and the French term "bâbord" (derived in turn from Middle Dutch).
Navigational lights.
At night, the port side of a boat or aircraft is indicated by a red navigation light at the bow. The opposite side of the bow has a green one to help avoid collisions. The "International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea" state that a ship on the left must give way to a ship on its right. If the courses of two boats are intersecting, the helmsman usually gives way to a red light by going around the stern of the stand-on vessel (the vessel that does not need to change course). A saying for this is:
"If to starboard red appear,&lt;br&gt; 
'tis your duty to keep clear...&lt;br&gt; 
Green to green, red to red&lt;br&gt; 
perfect safety, go ahead."

= = = Reasonable doubt = = =
Evidence that is beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard of evidence required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial legal systems. Generally, the prosecutor has the burden of proof and is required to prove their case to this standard. This means that the version of events being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a "reasonable person" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would "not" affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty. Beyond "the shadow of a doubt" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt. But this term extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term "reasonable doubt" is most commonly used.
If doubt "does" affect a "reasonable person's" belief that the defendant is guilty, then the jury is not satisfied beyond "reasonable doubt". The precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" are usually defined within jurisprudence of the applicable country. A related idea is William Blackstone's formulation: "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

There are around 450 lakes in Azerbaijan. All of them are small in area and volume. There are only 5 lakes with a surface area of more than . Most of these lakes are fresh water, but some of them are salt lakes. Some of these lakes were formed by tectonics, landslides, rivers (oxbow lake), and lagoons. In the mountainous areas, the lakes were formed by tectonics, landslides and glaciers (glacial lake). 

= = = Adversarial system = = =
The adversarial system or adversary system is a legal system used in the common law countries. It is a system where two advocates represent their parties' positions before an impartial person or group of people. This is usually a jury or judge who attempt to determine the truth of the case. It is in contrast to the inquisitorial system used in some civil law systems (i.e. those deriving from Roman law or the Napoleonic code). This is where a judge or group of judges opens an official inquiry and decides the case.
The adversarial system is the two-part system under which criminal law courts operate. On one side is the prosecution who usually represents the government. The other side is the defense who represents the defendant. Each party may call witnesses and ask questions. Each party may present evidence based on legal ethics and that is approved by the court. For example, legal ethics prevent a lawyer from calling a witness they know will lie on the witness stand. Justice is served when the most effective adversary is able to convince the jury or judge that his or her case is the correct one.

= = = Statute of limitations = = =
Statutes of limitations are laws passed by a legislative body in common law systems that set the maximum time after an event when a lawsuit may be filed. In civil law systems, similar provisions are typically part of their civil or criminal codes and known collectively as "periods of prescription". When the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes, the statute of limitations provides an absolute defense to the legal claim.
The intention of these laws is to make sure legal cases are brought to trial in a reasonable length of time.
A statute of limitations restricts when a case may be filed, but is not a deadline for the completion of a case. If a case is filed during the period specified in the statute of limitations, the case may be heard and decided by the court even after that period expires.
Civil lawsuits.
The statute of limitations is determined by the cause of action, and different causes of action may have different limitations period even within the same state or country. The limitations period may be extended to ensure fairness to the parties, for example, if the person making the claim was a minor at the time the legal claim arose, or if the defendant committed a wrongful act to conceal the legal claim from the injured plaintiff.
Typically the statute of limitations must be raised by the defense after a lawsuit is filed. If the defense does not claim that the legal action is barred by the statute of limitations, a court may find that the defense has been waived and allow a late-filed lawsuit to continue.
Criminal prosecution.
When a statute of limitations expires (runs out) in a criminal case, if the defendant or judge raises a statute of limitations defense, the person can no longer be placed on trial for that cause. In many cases the statute of limitations is jurisdictional, so that a defendant can get a dismissal of a charge even if the defense is not raised, but in some cases the defendant risks waiving the statute of limitations defense if it is not raised before conviction.

= = = Cause of action = = =
Under the law, a cause of action is a set of facts sufficient to justify a right to sue to obtain money, property, or the enforcement of a right against another party. It means literally the cause or reason why a party can make a legal case under the law. The term also refers to the legal theory upon which a plaintiff brings a lawsuit (such as breach of contract, battery, or false imprisonment). The legal document which carries a claim is often called a Statement of Claim in English law, or a Complaint in U.S. federal practice and in many U.S. states. A complaint identifies the court's jurisdiction, the alleged facts and the relief the plaintiff wants. It can be any communication notifying the party to whom it is addressed of an alleged fault which resulted in damages. This is often expressed in amount of money the receiving party should pay or reimburse.
Filing.
To pursue a cause of action, a plaintiff pleads or alleges facts in a complaint, the pleading that starts a lawsuit. A cause of action generally includes both the legal theory (the legal wrong the plaintiff claims to have suffered) and the remedy (the relief a court is asked to grant). Often the facts or circumstances that allow a person to seek judicial relief may create multiple causes of action. Although it is fairly easy to file a Statement of Claim in most jurisdictions. If it is not done properly, then the filing party may lose his case due to simple technicalities.
There are a number of specific causes of action, including: contract-based actions, statutory causes of action, torts such as assault, battery, invasion of privacy and fraud. The points a plaintiff must prove to win a given type of case are called the "elements" of that cause of action. For example, for a claim of negligence, the elements are: the (existence of a) duty, breach (of that duty), proximate cause (legal cause), and damages. If a complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support every element of a claim, the court, upon motion by the opposing party, may dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.
Responding.
The defendant to a cause of action must file an "Answer" to the complaint in which the "claims" can be admitted or denied. The answer may also contain counterclaims in which the "Counterclaim Plaintiff" states its own causes of action. Finally, the answer may contain affirmative defenses. Most defenses must be raised at the first possible opportunity. Either in the answer or by motion or are considered to be waived.

= = = French Americans = = =
French Americans (French: "Américain français"), also called Franco-Americans (French: "Franco-Américains") are Americans who identify themselves to be of French or French Canadian descent. About 11.8 million U.S. residents are of French or French Canadian descent. About 2 million speak French at home. An additional 750,000 U.S. residents speak a French-based creole language, according to the 2011 census.
Americans of French descent make up a substantial percentage of the American population. However French Americans are less visible than other similarly sized ethnic groups. This is due in part to the high degree of assimilation among Huguenot (French Protestant) settlers. Also, there is a tendency of French American groups to identify more strongly with "New World" regional identities. These include Québécois, French Canadian, Acadian, Cajun, or Louisiana Creole. This has prevented the development of a wider French American identity.

= = = Insanity defense = = =
In criminal trials, the insanity defense is the claim that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to a mental illness. People who have been determined to be insane have been exempt from full criminal punishment since the Code of Hammurabi. There are different definitions of legal insanity in different jurisdictions. A finding of insanity usually results in the defendant being confined in a mental health facility instead of a prison. The first to use this defense was Daniel Sickles when he killed his wife's lover Francis Barton Key (son of Francis Scott Key) in 1859.
Application.
In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, use of the insanity defense is rare. However, insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK. Mitigating factors, including things not eligible for the insanity defense like intoxication (or, more frequently, diminished capacity), may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences. 
The question of who bears the burden of proof is an issue in the United States. Before the John Hinckley, Jr. trial the burden of proof rested with the government in most states. Afterwards many of these states required the defense to prove the defendant was legally insane. Where the state still bears the burden of proof, the standard for the prosecution is beyond a reasonable doubt. Where the defense bears the burden, the standard is preponderance of the evidence (a lower standard).
Expert testimony.
The insanity defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction. Their testimony guides the jury (or judge in a bench trial). But they may not testify to the defendant's criminal responsibility. This is for the jury or judge to decide. Mental health experts may testify as to whether at the time of the crime the defendant understood what he did was wrong. If the defendant were acting under a delusion at the time and could still determine right from wrong, he is not insane and may be punished.

= = = Arbitration = = =
Arbitration, a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), is a way of resolving disputes outside the courts. Litigation can be expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. With arbitration the parties to a dispute agree to have the disagreement decided by a neutral third party. More often this is a panel of three arbitrators. Each party suggests one, then both arbitrators agree on a third arbitrator. The decision is the result of a majority vote.
Arbitration (hearing).
Arbitration includes an agreement in advance by both parties to comply with the decision of the arbitrator(s). The process includes a hearing in which both parties may be heard. The arbitrator(s) reviews the evidence in the case and makes a decision. One that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.
Mediation.
Another form of alternative dispute resolution is mediation. Mediation and arbitration both use neutral third parties. For that reason they are sometimes confused. One difference is that a mediator does not make any decisions. Instead the mediator works towards getting both parties to agree. Unlike Arbitration, there is usually only one mediator. Another difference is that mediation is usually non-binding. Mediation is used more often in smaller disputes or when the matter is kept confidential. In some jurisdictions, mediation is required before a case can come to court.

= = = Damages = = =
In law, damages are an award, usually of money. It is to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury. The rules for damages can and frequently do vary based on the type of claim which is presented (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim) and the jurisdiction. Damages are not the same as court costs which includes the costs to bring a legal case to court. The losing party may also have to pay court costs.
Categories.
In common law countries, damages are usually categorized into compensatory (or actual) damages, and punitive damages. Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages and general damages. Special damages include economic losses such as loss of earnings, property damage and medical expenses. General damages are noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. Statutory damages are those required by statute.
Compensatory damages.
Compensatory damages are paid to compensate the claimant for loss, injury, or harm suffered as a result of another's negligence (tort law). Expectation damages are used in contract law. In civil law countries, these are called "ordinary damages" and may be limited to actual loss.
Punitive damages.
Generally, punitive damages, which are also termed "exemplary damages" in the United Kingdom, are not awarded in order to compensate the plaintiff, but in order to reform or deter the defendant. They are also to intended to be an example to others not to do the same thing. Punitive damages are awarded when it is determined that compensatory damages are not enough. Punitive damages are awarded over and above the amount of compensatory damages, such as in the event of malice or intent. Great judicial restraint is expected to be exercised in their use. In the United States punitive damages awards are subject to the limitations imposed by the due process of law clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
Punitive damages in most civil law countries are not awarded. 
Statutory damages.
Statutory damages are an amount stated within the statute rather than calculated based on the degree of harm to the plaintiff. Lawmakers will provide for statutory damages for acts in which it is difficult to determine the value of the harm to the victim. Someone breaking the law can entitle the victim to a statutory award. This is even if no actual injury happened. 
For example, United States Civil Code 18 USC §§2520 provides for statutory damages to victims of various wiretapping offenses.

= = = Equity (law) = = =
In common law countries equity is based on a judiciary assessment of fairness. It is what is often what is considered fair and right under natural law. It is used when the laws themselves do not address an issue or are inadequate in some way. Examples of equity decisions include imposing a lien, correcting a property line or ordering someone to do something to prevent damage.
History.
Common law in England can be traced back to the Norman conquest. The laws, such as they were then, did not address every concern. At first, a subject (of the king) had to petition the king to ask to be heard in his court. One of the first instances of this was in 1070 when Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury had a case against Odo, Earl of Kent, the king's brother. The archbishop petitioned that lands taken by Odo be restored. Rules of equity began when it became apparent that the common law courts could not solve all legal problems. The king set up courts of chancery (equity). By the 1800s the equity courts were becoming obsolete. In 1875 Parliament did away with the chancery courts altogether.
States in New England followed the English tradition of maintaining separate courts for law and equity. Others, however, combined their courts with both types of jurisdiction. This is what Congress did with respect to the US federal courts. United States bankruptcy courts are the one example of US federal courts which operate as courts of equity.

= = = Commoners = = =
The terms commoners, common people or the masses refers to ordinary people who are members of neither the nobility nor the priesthood. In a system of social classes, they are those without title or rank. Since the 20th century, the term "common people" has been used in its place. It refers to typical members of society in contrast to those who are highly privileged (in either wealth or influence).
History.
In Europe, a concept of common people started in the classical antiquity of ancient Rome around the 6th century BC. The Roman social division was into patricians (nobles) and plebeians (commoners). The division may have been instituted by King Servius Tullius as an alternative to the previous three noble tribes or clans, whose divisions had caused conflict.
The ancient Greeks generally had no concept of class and their leading social divisions were simply non-Greeks, free-Greeks and slaves. With the growth of Christianity in the 4th century AD, a new world view arose in European thinking about social division, which continued until at least early modern times.
Saint Augustine stated that social division was a result of the Fall of Man. The three leading divisions were considered to be the priesthood (clergy), the nobility, and the common people. That would sometimes be expressed as "those who prayed", "those who fought" and "those who worked". The Latin terms for the three classes ("oratores", "bellatores" and "laboratores") are often found even in modern textbooks, and have been used in sources since the 9th century.

= = = Pseudogene = = =
Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their function. They have lost their gene expression in the cell or their ability to code protein. The term was coined in 1977.
Pseudogenes can result from mutations in a gene whose product is not needed for the survival of the organism. Although not protein-coding, the DNA of pseudogenes may be functional. It may be similar to other kinds of non-coding DNA which have a regulatory role.
Most have some gene-like features. They lack protein-coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling mutations, or their inability to encode RNA (such as with rRNA pseudogenes). 
Pseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic material that is to be removed from the genome, so they are often labeled as junk DNA. Pseudogenes contain fascinating biological and evolutionary histories in their sequences. This is due to a pseudogene's shared ancestry with a functional gene. In the same way that Darwin thought of two species as having a shared common ancestry followed by millions of years of evolutionary divergence (see speciation), a pseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a common ancestor and have diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years.

Criminal defenses.
In a criminal trial, there are a wide variety of defenses offered. Some of these include:
Many of the above are considered an affirmative defense in which case the burden of proof may be on the defendant to prove their innocence. Otherwise in a criminal trial the burden of proof usually rests with the prosecution. They must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

= = = Defence in depth = = =
Defense in depth (also known as deep or elastic defense) is a military strategy. The delaying tactic is intended not to stop the advance of an enemy but to slow it down. A defense in deep buys time by slowly yielding to the enemy and usually causes additional casualties. That may slow down an advancing army and cause it to lose momentum.
Examples.
Hannibal used the tactic at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC. Facing a much larger Roman army, he placed his less experienced soldiers in the centre and his most experienced fighters on both sides. When the Romans advanced, his centre gradually moved back, and the troops on the wings began to surround the Romans. That was the largest slaughter of Roman soldiers in the history of the Roman Republic.
The classic example is medieval hill forts and castles with rings of defenses (usually walls). The inner circles of defenders support the outer circles with missile fire. The attackers must breach all of the lines of defense and exhaust themselves in the process.
The German Army started to use the tactic in 1917, during World War I., and continued the tactic with a great effect against both the French Army and the British Army until July 1918. The arrival of the US Army, which joined the French and the British, ended the effectiveness of the tactic.
Strategy.
A properly-planned defense in depth may reduce or eliminate any advantage that attacking forces might havesuch as superior numbers. The defenders place the the attackers behind several layers of defense . The defenders then let the attackers wear down their forces, and the defenders slowly give ground and move back to the next layer of defense.
Carl von Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and the martial art of Budō consider the preferred form of war to be defense. Clausewitz stated that provides the defenders with additional . A defence in depth may prevent an enemy from surrounding a position and provides an excellent opportunity to counterattack.
A defense in space is being absent when an enemy attacks. A defense in time is slowing down or blocking an enemy that attacks.
Delaying action.
A similar tactic is called a delaying action. when a smaller force to harasses a larger force to delay its advance and to inflict as much damage as possible to the larger force without directly engaging it. That allows the defending army's main force to disengage an enemy and to maintain good order. The main force is given the time necessary to set up a new defensive position. The small force protecting the larger force is called a rearguard.
A famous rearguard example was given in the "Song of Roland". The nephew of Charlemagne, Roland, commanded the rearguard at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. He and his men protected the rear of the Frankish army while it retreated to France. In his delaying action, Roland and all of his men were killed in an ambush.

= = = Defense (sports) = = =

The defender also protects their own team's goalkeeper or goaltender. This is in association football, ice hockey, water polo and many other sports.
In American football the defense is the part of the team that is tasked with preventing the other team's ball carrier from scoring. The defense consists of 11 players.

A gene family is a set of several similar genes. They occur by the duplication of a single original gene. Usually they have similar biochemical functions. The idea that genes get duplicated is almost as old as the science of genetics. 
One such family are the genes for human haemoglobin subunits. The ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes, called the �-globin and �-globin loci. These two gene clusters are thought to have arisen from a precursor gene being duplicated, about 500 million years ago. 
The biggest gene family is said to be the olfaction genes. The homeobox genes are another important group. 
Genes for the immune system include several gene families. They code for the major histocompatibility complex, and the immunoglobulins. The toll-like receptors are the main sensors of infection in mammals.

= = = Evidence (law) = = =
In law, evidence is an object of some kind, a document of some kind, or the testimony of a person in a court of law. Evidence is used to show something is either true or false. Evidence has to follow rules in most jurisdictions. In the United States, for example, evidence was based on legal precedent until 1975. In that year Congress created the Federal Rules of Evidence. They became the official rules that all forms of evidence must follow in federal courts. Most states in the US use rules based on the federal rules. China, while a civil law country, has followed much of the US Federal Rules of Evidence in their " Uniform Provisions of Evidence".
A subpoena can be used to require a person or organization to provide documents used for evidence.
Admissibility of evidence.
In most jurisdictions there are exclusionary rules that automatically suppress certain kinds of evidence. For example, in the US, this may be evidence that violates the constitutional rights of a defendant. To be admissible in most jurisdictions, evidence must be relevant and it must be reliable.

= = = Impartiality = = =
An part of any of the world's legal systems is impartiality. It is important for tribunals, judges, juries and arbitrators to be impartial. It is equally important for the legal systems themselves to be impartial.
Judges and tribunals.
Judges cannot favor one party over another or give more weight to one side's claims than the other. Judges learn about the law from outside the courtroom and before a trial begins. Because of this a judge may have an opinion regarding the law. When a judge expresses these views he or she is not being impartial.
Juries.
In the US legal system, juries are screened and individuals selected by a process called "voir dire". Both the prosecution and the defense question jury candidates before a judge. This is to see if they can remain impartial. Any person having a personal interest in the outcome of the trial or who is obviously biased may be removed. This is called "striking" a juror. It is rare to have more than 10% of potential jurors struck from a trial. Trial by jury began in the United Kingdom. Except for cases where there is a provision by the law, it is the right of every person accused of a crime to have an impartial jury trial. More and more criminal trials are held without a jury. The less severe crimes are tried by magistrates. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right to a fair trial. In Canada juries are made up of 12 ordinary persons, male or female, who are expected to be impartial triers of fact. They decide whether the Crown (the prosecution) has made its case. Judges have the option of increasing the jury to 13 or 14 jurors, but only 12 may vote on the guilt or innocence of the accused. 
Juries in Scotland have 15 jurors. In many European civil law countries and Japan, juries can be made up of laypersons and judges. Also the opposing council may not be able to strike jurors as in the United States. 
Many believe the Magna Carta first guaranteed a right to trial by one's peers. The Latin "judicium parium" does not mean a trial by jury. The word "judicium" in the language of the day meant a judge. The term "liber homo", usually translated as "freeman", at that time were a limited class in England. So it did not mean every person.

He left the TCU program as its all-time leader in wins. He also holds several statistical passing records.
Dalton was selected by the Bengals in the second round (35th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, $5.2 million contract. Under a West Coast-style offensive scheme, Dalton and receiver A.J. Green, the Bengals' 2011 first-round selection from the University of Georgia, have become a great quarterback/receiver combination. Dalton and Green broke NFL records for completions (completed passes) and yards for a rookie quarterback/receiver combination.
Dalton is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to have thrown for over 3,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. The others are Cam Newton, Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, and Russell Wilson. Dalton is also one of five to have passed for at least 20 touchdowns in each of his first three seasons. He joins Manning, Luck, Wilson, and Dan Marino. Dalton is the only quarterback to lead the Cincinnati Bengals to four consecutive Playoffs. He is just one of five quarterbacks to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons. He is also the Bengals franchise record holder for passing yards and touchdowns in a season. 
Due to his red hair, Dalton has been nicknamed "The Red Rifle" by Bengals fans.

= = = Injunction = = =
An injunction is a court order that either commands or prevents a party from doing a specific act.
US law.
Injunctions can be temporary or permanent. A restraining order and a preliminary injunction are examples of temporary injunctions. Either may be issued early in a lawsuit to prevent either party from doing anything that might unfairly influence the outcome of the litigation. A permanent injunction is usually issued after a case is settled. It enforces the final decision of the court.
Australian apprehended violence orders.
In the state of New South Wales, an apprehended violence order (AVO) may be issued against a person from whom another person fears violence. They can be issued to prevent physical abuse, harassment or stalking. Any person who violates an AVO may be charged with a criminal offence.
UK injunctions and super-injunctions.
While the United Kingdom has injunctions much the same as other countries they also have super-injunctions. This is an injunction (sometimes called a gag-order) that prevents journalists from writing anything about a court case. It also prevents them from reporting that the injunction itself has been issued. If any injunction in the UK prevents details of the order from being known it is also called a super-injunction.
Anti-suit injunctions.
In common law countries anti-suit injunctions are court orders used to prevent a court or tribunal from assuming jurisdiction or taking over an ongoing lawsuit. An anti-suit injunction may also be used to prevent a party from filing a second lawsuit in another jurisdiction at the same time as the first case.

= = = Judgment (law) = = =
In law, a judgment is a decision of a court regarding the rights and liabilities of parties in a legal action or proceeding. Judgments also generally provide the court's explanation of why it has chosen to make a particular decision.
The phrase "reasons for judgment" is often used interchangeably with "judgment." The former refers to the court's reasons for arriving at the judgment it did. The latter refers to the final court order. a judgement, whether by a court or a tribunal, is the final part of a court case. The judgement is also called a legal decision.

= = = Case law = = =
Case law in a legal system are those laws based on previous judicial decisions. This is opposed to decisions based on existing statutes or regulations. In countries using common law, it is generally uncodified meaning there are no collections of legal rules, and laws to rely on. Instead they rely on legal precedent. Precedents are previous legal cases that are used as examples for deciding the present case. They are also binding on lower courts where the facts and issues are similar. In countries that use civil law, their laws are codified, and there is much less reliance on case law.
Common law.
Judges make judicial decisions based on precedent, and their own understanding when there are few or no precedents. This is "judge-made law" as compared to statuary law, which is made by legislatures, and governments. In the United States the courts can rule statutes, and regulations unconstitutional if they go beyond the authority given by the constitution. In the United Kingdom judge-made law, or common law cannot rule against statutes made by an act of Parliament. The judiciary, and legislative branches are not coequal. Judges, however, have traditionally used one of three ways of interpreting statutes: 
Civil law.
Judges make decisions by decisions based on the appropriate laws. They then investigate to learn all the facts. Finally they make a decision. Under civil law, judiciary decisions are not a critical part of forming civil laws. Under Dutch civil law for example, there are so many civil laws that it becomes difficult for lawyers and judges to know if they have found all the laws that apply to a case. Even with all the laws, not every situation is covered. The civil court will research everything it can on the subject, then make a decision. For this reason those who start a legal case never know for certain what the decision will be.

= = = Lien = = =
A lien ( or ) is a form of security interest attached to property to secure the payment of a debt to a creditor. A lien is usually a public record. The owner of the property is called the "lienee". The creditor or person holding the lien is called the "lienor" or "lien holder".
In the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of legal interests. It includes other forms of mortgage or charge. In the USA, a lien is a "non-possessory" security interests meaning the lien holder does not usually possess the property.
In other common law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest. The holder of a lien right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the USA, in other countries it refers to a purely "possessory" form of security interest. When possession of the property is lost, the lien is released. 

= = = Lanfranc = = =
Lanfranc (1005  1010 at Pavia — 24 May 1089 at Canterbury) was a cleric, teacher and jurist who became Archbishop of Canterbury under William the Conqueror.
This celebrated Italian jurist gave up his career to become a monk at Bec in Normandy. In 1070 he became the Archbishop of Canterbury in England. This was the peak of an extraordinary life.
Life.
Lanfranc was born in the early years of the 11th century at Pavia in Italy. His father, Hanbald, held a rank equivalent to a magistrate. He was orphaned at an early age. Lanfranc was trained in the liberal arts. He crossed the Alps, and took up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches. He taught for three years with much success. 
In 1042 he gave this up to become a monk in the newly founded Bec Abbey. He became the first prior of Bec Abbey in 1045. He became a friend of William, Duke of Normandy and by 1050 his counselor. Lanfranc then became the abbot of St Stephen in Normandy. 
In 1067, when Maurilius, Archbishop of Rouen, died, Lanfranc declined the position. He would not have been able to do so without the consent of William I. It is likely William had something bigger in mind for Lanfranc. In 1070 Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury was deposed by papal legates. William brought Lanfranc from Normandy to England to become the Archbishop of Canterbury.

= = = Security interest = = =
A security interest is a legal claim on collateral. The collateral can be real estate, personal property or any asset. Collateral is usually used to secure a loan. 
The borrower is the party who borrows the funds. The lender is the one who lends the money in return for a security interest. The lender can repossess the asset if the borrower fails to repay the loan. The lender can then sell the asset to repay the loan. A loan secured by collateral is called a "secured loan" (also called a lien). A loan with no collateral (such as a credit card) is an unsecured loan. There is nothing for the lender to repossess.
Different types.
There are different types of security interest or liens:

= = = William Benjamin Carpenter = = =
William Benjamin Carpenter MD MRCS CB FRS (29 October 1813 – 19 November 1885) was an English physician, invertebrate zoologist and physiologist. He was instrumental in the early stages of the unified University of London.
Carpenter was born on 29 Oct 1813 in Exeter, the eldest son of Dr Lant Carpenter, an important Unitarian preacher who influenced a "rising generation of Unitarian intellectuals". From his father, Carpenter inherited a belief in the essential lawfulness of the creation: this meant that natural causes were the explanation of the world as we find it. William embraced this "naturalistic cosmogeny" as his starting point.
Although qualified medically, he was best known for his work on marine zoology, notably the lower organisms such as Foraminifera and crinoids. These researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration, such as the 1868 oceanographic survey with "HMS Lightning" and later the more famous Challenger Expedition.
In the long term, however, he has become known as a founder of idea of the adaptive unconscious. He observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations were also made by Hermann Helmholtz. Perhaps because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were neglected for a hundred years. Carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. He noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious.
He also noticed that emotional reactions can occur outside of conscious until attention is drawn to them:
He also asserted both the freedom of the will and the existence of the ego.
In the popular mind, he was perhaps better nown for his work against alcoholism, for which he won a prize of 100 guineas. It was one of the first temperance books.
In 1856 Carpenter became Registrar of the University of London, and held the office for twenty-three years. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

= = = Particle detector = = =
A particle detector, also known as a radiation detector, is a device used to , , and/or high-energy particles. These particles can be made by nuclear decay, cosmic radiation, or reactions in a particle accelerator. Particle detectors are used in particle physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear engineering. Modern detectors are also used as calorimeters to measure the energy of radiation. They can measure other things, such as the momentum, spin, or charge of the particles.
Description.
Detectors designed for modern accelerators are very big. They are also very expensive. They are called "counters" when they simply count particles, but do not measure anything else. Usually, particle detectors can also track ionizing radiation (high energy photons or even visible light).
Examples and types.
Many of the detectors invented so far are ionization detectors (such as gaseous ionization detectors and semiconductor detectors) and scintillation detectors. Other principles, such as Čerenkov light and transition radiation, have also been applied to detect particles.
Applications.
Some detectors are used to measure the amount of radiation so that people can protect themselves from it. Others are used to study nuclear and particle physics.
Detectors have also been used in archaeology. Muon detectors can "see" through solid material such as stone and concrete. Used this way, archaeologists and physicists discovered a room (a burial chamber) behind a wall underground in Naples, Italy.

= = = Pleading = = =
Pleading is usually the first step in a lawsuit. This is when parties formally submit their claims and defenses. A "complaint" is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which starts the lawsuit. A complaint lists the relevant allegations of fact which leads to one or more legal causes of action. It also has a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed. This is called an "ad quod damnum" clause. In some situations, a complaint is called a "petition". In this case the party filing a complaint is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a "petition" or a "bill of complaint in chancery".

= = = Complaint = = =
In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that establishes the facts and legal reasons for a lawsuit. A complaint must list the reasons for the plaintiff's case, and it must ask for a specific legal remedy. Once a complaint is filed with the court a summons (an order from the court) is notifies the defendant a lawsuit has been filed against them. Once a defendant receives notice of a complaint, they must reply within a specified period of time with an answer. Complaints are pleadings that must be written carefully to properly state the facts and legal basis for the claim. Usually this requires the help of an attorney.
In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be started by the filing of a complaint. This is also called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. All criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority. This is the same authority whose criminal laws were broken and who enforces criminal statutes. The government is sometimes called "the state", "the People" or "the Crown" (in Commonwealth realms). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most US jurisdictions, the document presented to and authorized by a grand jury is called an indictment.

= = = Vitamin B12 = = =
Vitamin B12 (or vitamin B-12) is also called cobalamin. It has a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and in the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. 
B12 is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Fungi, plants and animals (including humans) cannot produce vitamin B12. Only bacteria and archaea have enzymes for its synthesis, although animals can convert it to the version they need. 
Many foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis. It is produced by some of the gut flora of herbivores. Carnivores, of course, eat herbivores. Also algae and plants get it from symbiosis. So, by one route or another, animals must get vitamin B12 from bacteria (and archaea).
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin. It can be produced industrially only by bacterial fermentation-synthesis.
Vitamin B12 is a group of chemically related compounds, all of which have vitamin activity. It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt sitting in the center of a ring called a corrin ring. In the human body it is converted to the human physiological forms.
Vitamin B12 was discovered by its relationship to pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease. Because an "intrinsic factor" is needed for B12 to be absorbed, its lack causes a vitamin B12 deficiency. Many other kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency have since been found.

= = = Louis Agassiz = = =
Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (May 28, 1807 – December 14, 1873) was a Swiss-born and European-trained biologist and geologist. His work on natural history in Europe and the Americas was important.
His reputation now is less good, because he fought against the theory of evolution, and held wrong ideas about human races. He thought the different human races were of different origins. This idea is called "polygenism". Darwin's comment at the end is interesting:
After visiting Harvard University in mid-career, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1847 and became a professor of zoology and geology at Harvard. He founded its Museum of Comparative Zoology.
Agassiz made extensive contributions to ichthyology (including extinct species). He founded glaciology, the study of ice fields and ice ages.

= = = Steppe Geoglyphs = = =
The Steppe Geoglyphs are a number of Neolithic earth constructions in the Turgay Trough area of Turgai in northern Kazakhstan. There are at least 260 of these earthworks.
Many or all of them are smaller earthworks (mounds, trenches and ramparts) arranged with each other to make geometric and other shapes (composite figures). These shapes are squares, rings and three others. The composite figures range from slightly under 90 m in length to over 400 m in diameter.
Besides being made of earth dug out and piled up, some of the geoglyphs are made by placing stones next to each other. 
Some of the large shapes have been given names, including Bestamskoe Ring, Ushtogaysky ("or" Ushtogay) Square, Turgay triradial swastika, Large cross Ashtasti, Ekedyn cross, Ashutasti ring, Kyzyloba line, Koga cross, and Shili square. 
Optical dating (optically stimulated luminescence) was used to get a date for these structures. The results indicate that they date between eight and one thousand years ago. 
The earthworks were discovered in 2007 by Dimitriy Dey. He found them when he was looking at Google Earth. He had been looking for pyramids or similar structures in Kazakhstan. The geoglyphs were first reported to the scientific community in 2014.
Road construction in 2013 damaged one of the structures. 

= = = Right to a fair trial = = =
The right to fair trial is an essential right in all countries respecting the rule of law. A trial in these countries that is considered unfair will typically be restarted, or its verdict thrown out. Some of the rights that make a trial fair are explicitly proclaimed in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They are clearly stated in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They are also stated in Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the world. There is no binding international law that defines what is or is not a fair trial. For example, the right to a jury trial and other important procedures vary from nation to nation.

= = = Due process = = =
Due process is the legal requirement that the government must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this is a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.
A judiciary process.
Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings. This means that judges—instead of legislators—may define and guarantee basic fairness, justice, and liberty. This interpretation has proven controversial, and is seen as being closer to the concepts of natural justice, and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions. This interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.
History.
Due process developed from clause 39 of the Magna Carta in England. The Magna Carta called it "the law of the land" which became the more modern term due process. When English and American law gradually went in different directions, due process was not upheld in England, but did become part of the Constitution of the United States. It is found in the Fifth Amendment which says "No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,". It is applied to all states by the Fourteenth Amendment.
In other legal systems.
Due process is not used in contemporary English law. But it recognizes two similar concepts are natural justice and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process. It contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England. 
Islamic law provides for due process. It includes the presumption of innocence, the right to remain silent and a fair and public trial before a judge. There is no jury and both parties, the injured party and the accused, usually present their own cases.
Scandinavia gets high ratings by the World Justice Project. They were noted for their criminal justice system including their observance of due process. As of the 2013 "Rule of Law Index", the Scandinavian countries were rated higher than the US for due process. The three lowest rated countries in the index were Afghanistan, Zimbabwe and Venezuela.

= = = Roosevelt Island Bridge = = =
The Roosevelt Island Bridge is a bridge in New York. It is a lift bridge. It connects Roosevelt Island in Manhattan to Astoria in Queens. It crosses the East Channel of the East River. The bridge is the only route to the island for vehicles and foot traffic, except for public transportation.
History.
Construction of the bridge began on March 17, 1952. The cost was $6.5 million. It opened on May 18, 1955, as the Welfare Island Bridge. The name was changed to the "Roosevelt Island Bridge" in 1973.
Before the bridge was built, the only way vehicles could access Roosevelt Island was by using an elevator on the Queensboro Bridge. The elevator was torn down in 1970.
In 2001, the New York City Department of Transportation considered converting the Roosevelt Island Bridge into a fixed bridge. This was to reduce the cost of its maintenance. The bridge is rarely opened (raised for ships to go underneath), because most ships passing by Roosevelt Island use the West Channel of the East River. Most of the bridge openings occur in September during the General Assembly at the United Nations. During this time the West Channel is closed for security reasons.
Navigation.
When the bridge is raised for ships to go underneath, the distance between the water and the bridge is . The bridge is wide. Its total length, including approaches, is . The main span (distance across) is long.
The Roosevelt Island Bridge provides direct access to the 'Motorgate Parking Garage', which was designed to minimize vehicle traffic on the island. The garage was completed in 1974 and later expanded in 1990.

= = = The Mighty Mighty Bosstones = = =
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (informally known as The Bosstones) are an American ska punk band from Boston, Massachusetts which formed in 1983. The Bosstones are widely credited as one of the originators of the genre of ska punk, a style which mixes the rhythms of ska music with the fast tempo and distortion of punk rock and hardcore punk.
 Their music is recognized for its prominent use of brass instruments as well as the deep, raspy voice of their lead singer Dicky Barrett. Their concerts are also notable for the presence of Ben Carr, a non-musician member of the Bosstones who dances onstage during the band's performances.
First becoming notable in the underground music scene, the Bosstones steadily grew in popularity throughout the mid-1990s. Their fourth album, 1994's "Question the Answers", sold over 500,000 copies and became a gold record. In 1995, they appeared in the hit movie "Clueless" and in 1997, the band released their most successful album, "Let's Face It", which sold over one million copies and spawned the hit single "The Impression That I Get", which charted at #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Songs and entered the top 20 in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Although none of the Bosstones' future albums or singles were able to meet with the same kind of success, the band has kept a loyal following and continue to tour and record.
The Bosstones briefly disbanded in 2003, though reunited in 2007 to continue touring and recording. The band has released nine studio albums, three EPs and a live album.

= = = Old English poetry = = =
The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation. Bede says this was by Cædmon (flourished 658–680). He was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced poetry at a monastery at Whitby. This is probably the earliest written Anglo-Saxon poetry we have.
Much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically. Estimates for the date of the great epic "Beowulf" range from AD 608 through to AD 1000, and there has never been agreement. 
It is possible to identify some key moments. "The Dream of the Rood" was written before about AD 700, when parts were carved in runes on the Ruthwell Cross. Some poems on historical events, such as "The Battle of Brunanburh" (937) and "The Battle of Maldon" (991), seem to have been written shortly after the events, so they can be dated reasonably precisely.
Anglo-Saxon poetry is known by the manuscripts in which it survives. The most important manuscripts are from the late 10th and early 11th centuries. They are known as the Cædmon manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Beowulf manuscript.
"Beowulf" is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase. 
With one notable exception (the so-called "Rhyming Poem"), Anglo-Saxon poetry depends on alliteration for its structure. Any rhyme included is just ornamental.

= = = Vertical-lift bridge = = =
A vertical-lift bridge or lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the road surface.
The vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge. They are generally easier to design and easier to build. They usually cost less to build for longer moveable spans. The counterweights in a vertical lift bridges are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck. Bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted. As a result, heavier materials can be used in the deck, and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use.
Although most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each with counterweights. Some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck. An example is the span bridge at St Paul Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Another design used balance beams to lift the deck with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers. An example of this kind is the La Salle Street Bridge in Chicago, Illinois, USA.
The biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge is the height restriction for ships passing under it. This is a result of the deck remaining suspended above the water.

The phrase law of the land (Latin lex terrae) is a legal term. It means all of the laws in force within a country or region. The term was first used in the Magna Carta.

It is the same as due process of law as justified by the Constitution.
History.
While the Magna Carta first used the term, it did not actually become the law of the land until the reign of Edward I of England. It became closely associated with another phrase that helped define the law of the land' due process. During the reign of Edward II the Liberty of Subjects Act of 1354 stated:
 The law of the land and the Liberty of Subjects act remained in use in England. Both were used in colonial charters and common law. They became part of US laws after the American colonies declared their independence from England in 1776.

= = = Accounting software = = =
Accounting software is a program that can run on a computer to track the total value of a company. Accounting software can be downloaded to a computer or can be used through a browser window by logging into a website.
Before computers all accounting information was stored in books called "ledgers". A general ledger was the book where the accountant wrote down all payments that came into a company and all payments that were made. A common term for keeping track of this information is called "keeping the books". A bookkeeper is another term for an accountant, but can sometimes means a person who does accounting but maybe doesn't have as much formal education as an accountant.
Accounting software can automate many of the more menial tasks of accounting. For example, many accounting software companies automatically pull in bank information. Instead of having to put in the payments made and cashed received, the program does it for you.

= = = Foundation series = = =
The "Foundation" series is a series of seven science fiction stories written by Isaac Asimov. They follow on from each other. 
The three original books.
"Foundation" was originally a series of eight short stories published in "Astounding Magazine" between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire".
Asimov wrote the three books "Foundation", "Foundation and Empire" and the "Second Foundation" in 19501952. They dealt with a remarkable two-part idea. The Foundation was a research project, run by advanced social forecasting and social planning. It is based on the ideas of the character called Hari Seldon. Seldon developed "psychohistory". This method predicts the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the fall of the Galactic Empire, which includes the entire Milky Way, and a dark age lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. 
"Foundation and Empire" tells how the Empire was destroyed, and what followed. 
The Foundation takes over what remains of the Empire, and applies its social science methods. The now peaceful galaxy is disrupted by an unpredictable event. A mysterious person arises. He is known only as "the Mule". The Mule is a mutant, and can sense and manipulate the emotions of others, often creating fear. He uses this ability to take over the independent systems bordering the Foundation, and conquers the Galaxy.
"Second Foundation" is about the Mule's search for the Second Foundation, which has been tucked away in a hard-to-find part of the galaxy. As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes out of hiding to face him. It is a collection of the most intelligent humans in the galaxy. Using its strongest minds, the Second Foundation wears down the Mule. His destructive attitude is adjusted to a benevolent one. He returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.
The later books.
Thirty years later, he wrote the sixth and seventh books that tell what happened later. Then he wrote the first and second books that tell what happened before.
The books in order of the plot are:
An account of the series is as follows:
10,000 years in the future, all humans in the Galaxy live in an empire, ruled by an Emperor on the planet Trantor. Dr. Hari Seldon, a mathematician , arrives on Trantor to give a talk. He has an idea that the history of the human race can be predicted by mathematics, but the problem is too much for him alone. Seldon can see that the fall of the empire is coming and wants to help preserve the science of humans.
With the assistance of Dors Venabili, Yugo Amaryl and many others, Seldon spends his whole life to create a ‘Foundation’. This foundation is a colony of scientists on Terminus, which is an isolated planet far away from Trantor. Their job is to become the foundation for a new empire. He is also assisted by Eto Demerzel, a high government official, who is secretly a robot named Daneel Olivaw. Daneel is many thousands of years old. Seldon asks his grand-daughter Wanda, who has unusual mental powers, to help create a secret Second Foundation.
After Seldon’s death, the people on Terminus create new and powerful technology. They take over nearby planets and start trading with other planets. The Foundation fights the armies of the empire that attack them, but as Seldon thought would happen, the empire armies are defeated.
A mysterious man, known only as the Mule, has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation with his armies. No-one has seen him and no one knows how he manages to conquer them. Ebling Mis, a scientist, thinks he has discovered the reason; the Mule has mental powers that help him to make his enemies loyal to him. Mis has also discovered where the Second Foundation is located, but dies before he can tell anyone. 
The leader of the secretive Second Foundation, who also has strong mental powers, comes face-to-face with the Mule, and adjusts his mind so that he will not conquer anymore and will leave the Foundation alone.
Golan Trevize, a politician on Terminus, travels by spaceship with Janov Pelorat, to find the Second Foundation. They visit many planets but find no evidence of it. But Pelorat thinks that it may exist on the planet known as Earth. 
Meanwhile, Stor Gendibal, a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers that people with mental powers – known as Mentalics – exist. They are a force as powerful as the Mule was, and more powerful than even the Second Foundation. 
Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia, which is inhabited solely by Mentalics. Trevize is made to decide what the future of the galaxy will be. Gaia plans to absorb the entire Galaxy into one shared intellect. Gendibal is sent back home to the Second Foundation, which is actually secretly based on Trantor.
Trevize and Pelorat continue with the search for Earth with an inhabitant of Gaia known as Bliss. They search for a long time and eventually discover Earth. Earth no longer has any people living on it. They travel to the Earth's satellite, known as the Moon. There they meet a robot called Daneel Olivaw.
Olivaw explains that he has been guiding human history for thousands of years, and that he helped Seldon to set up the original Foundation. This is how the Seldon plan has remained on course. Olivaw tells them that his electronic brain cannot last much longer and that he is going to die. He explains that he must combine his mind with an organic (human) mind before this happens.
Isaac Asimov planned to continue the stories, but was unable to do so. Other authors have written stories to suggest what happened next.

= = = Kepler's laws = = =
Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three laws that describe the motion of planets around the sun:
Johannes Kepler found these laws, between 1609 and 1619. 
Comparison to Copernicus.
Kepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:
The eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the rules above give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus's.
Kepler's corrections are not at all obvious:
The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the sun parallel to the equator of the earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately
which is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).
The calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21

The tourists are travelling in a vessel called "Selene", that skims along the surface.
A 'moonquake' (similar to an earthquake) causes the dust to collapse, and "Selene" sinks below the surface. They cannot make contact with Control to call for help, and they only have enough air for a few days. The people are also generating heat, which is dangerous.
Captain Pat Harris and his stewardess Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied while waiting to be rescued. They are helped by a retired explorer, Commodore Hansteen.
Back at control, Chief Engineer Lawrence prepares to search for the lost tourists, although he doesn't think it can be done in time. But the trail left by Selene is seen by telescope from a satellite high above the Moon. The rescue attempt goes ahead.
Lawrence and his team do find the sunken ship and dig down through the dust to cut a hole in the hull. The tourists are able to climb out to safety, but with seconds to spare before Selene fills with dust and also catches fire.
Pat Harris and Sue Wilkins get married.

According to published Transcripts of Johnson's presidential telephone conversations, some major officials did not want to form this commission. Also that several commission members took part only reluctantly. One of their chief reservations was that a commission would create more controversy and people's fears would be proved valid.
The 88th U.S. Congressional session passed Senate joint resolution 137 authorizing the Presidential appointed Commission to report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Its 889-page final report was presented to President Johnson on September 24, 1964. It was made public three days later. It concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald.

= = = Christmas carol = = =
A Christmas carol (also called a noël, from the French word meaning "Christmas") is a carol (song or hymn) whose lyrics are on the theme of Christmas. They are traditionally sung on Christmas itself or during the surrounding holiday season. 
History.
Carols were first sung thousands of years ago in Europe. They were sung by pagans at the celebration of the Winter solstice. Later, medieval carols were sung in elaborate formal rituals (such as the Catholic Mass). As they are known today, Christmas carols date back to about the 19th century. The tradition of going from house to house was not a part of Christmas caroling at first. It dates back further to Anglo-Saxon traditions. the word "wassail" comes from the Anglo-Saxon toast "Wæs þu hæl", meaning "be in good health". Wassailing likely predates the Norman conquest in 1066. The wishing of good fortune to neighbors produced the song "Here We Come-A-Wassailing". Another song, "We Wish You a Merry Christmas", also comes from the Wassailing tradition. The two forms, singing and wassailing, came together during the Victorian era in England. They produced the modern custom of Christmas caroling. Today Christmas carols are a very known tradition.
Christmas carols in classical music.
In the 1680s and 1690s, two French composers added carols into their works. Louis-Claude Daquin wrote 12 noels for the organ. Marc-Antoine Charpentier wrote a few instrumental versions of noels, plus one major choral work "Messe de minuit pour Noël". Other examples include:

= = = A Study in Scarlet = = =
A Study in Scarlet is a detective mystery novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It introduces his new characters, the detective Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Dr. John Watson. They became two of the most famous characters in literature.
Conan Doyle wrote the story in 1886, and it was published the next year. Holmes describes the story's murder investigation as his "study in scarlet": "There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it".
The story and its main characters attracted little public interest when it first appeared. It was published in "Beeton's Christmas Annual" for 1887. Only 11 complete copies of the Annual exist now, and they have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories about Holmes, "A Study in Scarlet" is one of only four full-length Holmes novels. The novel was followed by "The Sign of the Four", published in 1890.
"A Study in Scarlet" was the first work of detective fiction to have the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.

Finding that he must move to cheaper lodgings, he makes the acquaintance of Sherlock Holmes -an eccentric student of chemistry and crime; this however is a sideline-Holmes real profession is that of a private consulting detective-with an extraordinary memory for both observation and knowledge Holmes can deduce both a persons profession and where they have been. Detective Gregson of Scotland Yard letters Holmes to consult him on a murder case. Holmes and Watson go to the scene of the crime-Holmes deduces that the victim Enoch Drebber had been poisoned; that the murderer smoke cigars; was over six feet tall and had a florid complexion, and that the cause of the murder was a woman. Despite a false start, Holmes tries to trap the killer with a fake ring advertisement but fails. The second murder is of secretary Joseph Strangerson who was stabbed in his hotel room. One clue is a small pillbox containing two pills-one harmless and one a poison. Holmes has a cabman try to lift his trunk-and arrests the cabman Jefferson Hope by name as the killer. Taken to Scotland Yard, Hope- who is dying from a weak heart- confesses: over twenty years before he was engaged to marry the daughter of a wealthy farmer in Salt Lake City Utah; however Strangerson killed the father and Drebber forced the girl to marry him; she died within a month of a broken heart; Hope vowed revenge and after many years traced Drebber and Strangerson to Cleveland Ohio; the now wealthy Drebber had Hope imprisoned; when Hope was released he found that Drebber and Strangerson fled to Europe-; St Petersburg Russia; Cobenhagen Denmark; Paris, France and then to London. Hope got himself hired as a Cabman so he could spy out his query. Drebber and Stragerson split up; the drunken Drebber gets himself thrown out of his boarding house for trying to court the landlady's daughter. Hope takes Drebber in his cab to the murder scene and confronts Drebber with his real identity. He then forces Drebber to take a pill while he eats the second one. Drebber dies looking at his wives wedding ring; Hope then goes after Strangerson and offers him the same choice-Starangerson tries to strangle Hope who stabs him. Hope decides to earn a little more money to go back to America even though he admits he has nothing left to live for having accomplished his revenge, when he hears a Baker Street Irregeler [a gang of boy spies employed by Holmes] inquire for him by name for a cab job. That very night Hopes heart bursts in his cell; after Holmes and Watson read about it in the newspaper Watson begins to write for the public an 18-year career of Holmes consulting work.

= = = Molecular geometry = = =
Molecular geometry is the way atoms are arranged in a molecule. The three-dimensional arrangement determines many properties of that molecule. There are many different molecular structures. They are organised by the number of atoms involved and the angles between the bonds.
Types of molecular geometry.
The wide variety of different molecular structures depends on the number of atoms involved as well as the number of electron pairs, and these also determine the bond angles of the atoms. For example, a linear molecule will have a bond angle of 180° because the two atoms bonded to the central atom of a molecule are separated at a maximum angle of 180° equally opposite to each other. Bent molecules will have a bond angle of less than 180° but still have only two atoms bonded to the central atom of a molecule. That is because bent molecules have got electron pairs in the central atom that count as the electrons that will be separated from other atoms bonded to it.

= = = Jessie Hill = = =
Jessie Hill (December 9, 1932 – September 17, 1996) was an American R&amp;B and Louisiana blues singer and songwriter. He was best known for his popular call and response song "Ooh Poo Pah Doo". As a singer, he recorded a successful single. In addition to his original, there have been over 100 cover versions made by other artists.
Early life.
Hill was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. While still a teenager, he played drums in local bands. In 1951, while still drumming, he started his own group, the House Rockers. At first, Professor Longhair played piano, then later it was Huey "Piano" Smith. Hill got different musicians for the House Rockers in 1958, and started singing.
Career.
The idea for the song "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" began from some music played by a local pianist, who had the nickname Big Four. Hill wrote the lyrics and melody. Over time, while performing it on stage, it became a longer song. Hill also added an opening part written by Dave Bartholomew. In the end, the song became "a nonsensical yet rollicking call-and-response workout that perfectly captures the energy of French Quarter life...".
Hill recorded a demo that he shopped to local record labels, finally recording a session at Cosimo Matassa's studio. The record was produced by Allen Toussaint. When it was released in early 1960, it became popular, especially during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. That year, the record sold 800,000 copies and reached the Top 5 in the US "Billboard" R&amp;B chart. It was in the Top 30 in the "Billboard" Hot 100 pop chart as well. There have been over 100 cover versions of "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" recorded and performed live over the years by other popular musicians.
Other records he made in New Orleans were not as successful. He then moved to California and worked with other musicians from New Orleans, including Harold Battiste and Mac Rebennack. Songs he wrote there were recorded by Ike Turner and Tina Turner, (singing together as "Ike &amp; Tina Turner"), Sonny Bono and Cher (singing together as "Sonny &amp; Cher") and Willie Nelson.
Later life and death.
Stil living in California, a 1972 solo album was not successful at all. He ended up living in poverty and had a drinking problem. He moved back to New Orleans in 1977. He continued to drink alcohol and use narcotics. After he was arrested for drunk driving, he could no longer earn money driving his black Cadillac as a taxi. For a while he was homeless. There were several benefit concerts given to try to help him, but he did not recover from his failures.
Hill died of heart and renal failure in New Orleans in September 1996. He was 63. He is buried in Holt Cemetery in New Orleans, in a grave for the poorest citizens of the city.
Family.
Two of his grandsons are James and Troy "Trombone Shorty" Andrews. The pair performed "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" in Episode 7 of the HBO series "Treme". A third grandson, Travis "Trumpet Black" Hill, also performed as a trumpet player in New Orleans. He died from an infection while on tour in Tokyo on May 4, 2015.

= = = Mating = = =
Mating is the pairing of opposite-sex or hermaphrodite organisms. It is usually for sexual reproduction. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals. Other definitions extend the term to crossing in plants and fungi. It is usual for mating in plants or fungi to be called cross-fertilization, or "crossing" if the offspring have DNA from both genetic sources. 
Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for internal fertilization. Fertilization is the actual fusion of gametes.
Mating may also lead to external fertilization. This is done by amphibians, most fish, many lower animals, and plants. Many aquatic species just spread their eggs and sperm in the water at one specific time of year. That time varies between species. 
For some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not needed because the parent organism can self-fertilize (autogamy). In some flowering plants self-pollination can happen within the same flower, and some hermaphrodite animals self-fertilize. Many gastropods are hermaphrodite, and do simultaneous copulation in pairs. So do earthworms. 
In some birds, mating includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of artificial insemination of domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.

= = = This Land Is Your Land = = =
"This Land Is Your Land" is one of the best known folk songs in the United States. Its lyrics were written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie in 1940, based on a melody that already existed. Guthrie's melody was very similar to the melody of "Oh, My Loving Brother". This was a Baptist gospel hymn that had been recorded by the Carter Family as "When the World's On Fire", and had inspired their "Little Darlin', Pal of Mine." He used the same melody for the chorus and the verses.
Guthrie did not like Irving Berlin's song "God Bless America", sung at that time by Kate Smith. Guthrie was angry with the positive (smug) attitude of the song. He thought it was not realistic and the words sounded too proud of the country. The song was popular and was being played on the radio all the time. Tired of hearing it on the radio, he wrote a response originally named "God Blessed America For Me".
Guthrie rewrote the lyrics and the title over time and the song finally became "This Land Is Your Land". He sometimes added more overtly political verses in line with his views of communism than appear in recordings or publications.
Although Gutrie wrote the song in 1940, he did not record it until 1944. The song was not published until 1945, when it was included in a mimeographed booklet of ten songs with typed lyrics and hand drawings. The booklet was sold for twenty-five cents, and was copyrighted in 1951.
The first known professionally printed publication was in 1956 by Ludlow Music (now a unit of The Richmond Organization), which administered the publishing rights to Guthrie's song. Ludlow later issued versions with piano and guitar accompaniments.
In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

= = = Genome editing = = =
Genome editing is a type of genetic engineering.
DNA is inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases, or "molecular scissors". The nucleases make specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired places in the genome. The cell’s own mechanisms repair the induced break(s) by natural processes. 
At present there are four families of engineered nucleases being used.
To understand the function of a gene or a protein one interferes with it in a sequence-specific way, and watches its effects on the organism. However, in some organisms it is difficult or impossible to do site-specific mutation. Therefore more indirect methods have to be used. Examples are: 
Genome editing was chosen by Nature Methods as the 2011 Method of the Year. The technique is already being used, but implanting modified embryos into a woman is not yet permitted.
The CRISPR/Cas9 method.
In 2017 this system was announced as one of the biggest scientific achievements of the year. Cas9 is an enzyme which, with a guide RNA, can put a new sequence of DNA into a genome. Sir John Skehel said "That might allow you to knock out a particular gene in a cell, or introduce a particular gene, or correct a particular mutated gene that you want to work better".

= = = Small interfering RNA = = =
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 base pairs long. 
siRNA plays many roles, but it is most notable in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where it interferes with the expression of certain genes. Genes are only affected if they have nucleotide sequences complementary to those of the siRNA. 
siRNA functions by breaking down mRNA after transcription. This prevents translation of the gene into protein. siRNA also acts in RNAi-related pathways, e.g., as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the chromatin structure of a genome. The complexity of these pathways is only now being worked out.

= = = Isometry = = =
Isometry is a concept of geometry. Isometry means that one shape can be transformed into another, but metrics such as the arrangement of the points in relation to each other stay the same. An isometry is a special way of changing things that makes sure the distance between every two points stays the same in both places.An isometry is a special kind of function that moves points around from one place to another. Some of these ways include turning objects, moving them in a straight line, flipping them, sliding them, or not moving them at all.
Most transformation that repeats itself after every two moves can either be a mirror image or a rotation by half. Every movement in a flat surface can be made by reflecting it at most three times. Every small group of transformations has at least one point that doesn't move. To be an isometry, a function needs to keep the distances between all points in both places the same. The distance from x to y is the same as the distance from f(x) to f(y).
If you draw something and then move it a certain way, the distances between the points on the first drawing will be the same as on the new drawing. Isometries are useful tools in many areas of mathematics, such as studying shapes, patterns, and how numbers behave. Metric spaces are helpful in Math because they help us study things like symmetry, congruence, and transformations. 

= = = Skeletal muscle = = =
Skeletal muscle is a form of "striated" (striped) muscle tissue. It is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers that are known as tendons. It is one of three muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. 
Skeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as "muscle fibres". Muscle fibres do the work when muscles contract. A great deal is known about their structure and how they work. They contract when they get a nerve impulse.

= = = Cardiac muscle = = =
A cardiac muscle (heart muscle) is one of the three main types of muscle in vertebrates. It is involuntary: a person cannot control it consciously. Also, it is a in the walls of the heart. It makes up the tissue called the myocardium. 
The other types of muscle are the skeletal and smooth muscle. The cells that make up cardiac muscle have one (74%) or two (24.5%) nuclei. The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer epicardium layer and the inner endocardium layer.
Coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle cells in the heart force blood out of the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary circulatory systems. This mechanism illustrates systole (contraction) of the heart.
Cardiac muscle cells, unlike most other tissues in the body, rely on the coronary arteries to deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products directly. There is no time for them to diffuse.
Problems of the myocardium.
The heart muscle can become sick and weak. For example, if a person has very high blood pressure (hypertension), part of the heart muscle can get overworked. The heart muscle becomes bigger and cannot do its job as well. This is called hypertrophy.
If a person has a problem with the system that controls the heart, the heart muscle may not beat the way it needs to. It may beat too slowly to get blood out to the body (this is called bradycardia). Or it may beat so fast that the heart does not have time to fill with blood and then squeeze the blood out to the body. This is called tachycardia (there are many kinds).
The heart gets blood through the coronary arteries. These are special blood vessels that carry blood only to the heart. In order to do its job, the heart muscle needs a constant supply of blood and oxygen from the coronary arteries. If these coronary arteries get blocked, blood flow to the heart muscle can stop. Without blood flow, the heart muscle gets no oxygen. If this lasts long enough, the part of the heart muscle which is not getting enough oxygen dies. This is called a myocardial infarction, or a heart attack.

Something that is unconstitutional refers to an action by a government that s that government's authority. Most constitutions establish the powers that a government may have. Only a government action can violate a state or federal constitution. An example is the US Constitution that guarantees that the United States may not have an official religion. This is why holiday decorations at a city hall displaying only Christian images would be unconstitutional.

= = = Spectre (2015 movie) = = =
Spectre is a 2015 British-American spy movie and the twenty-fourth "James Bond" series produced by Eon Productions for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures. It is the fourth movie to feature Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond and the second movie in the series directed by Sam Mendes following "Skyfall", and was written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth. It is the last "James Bond" movie to be distributed by Columbia Pictures, as Universal Pictures will internationally distribute the next movie in the series, "No Time to Die".
The story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation Spectre and their enigmatic leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), who plans to launch a national surveillance network to mastermind criminal activities across the globe. The movie marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions movie since 1971's "Diamonds Are Forever"; a character resembling Blofeld had previously appeared in the 1981 movie, "For Your Eyes Only", but, because of the "Thunderball" controversy, he is not named, nor is his face shown. Several "James Bond" characters, including M, Q and Eve Moneypenny, return, with new additions Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann, Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh and Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra.
"Spectre" was filmed from December 2014 to July 2015 in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies. "Spectre" was estimated to have cost around $245 million—with some sources listing it as high as $300 million—making it the most expensive Bond movie and one of the most expensive movies ever made.
"Spectre" was released on 26 October 2015 in the United Kingdom on the same night of the world premiere at the London Royal Albert Hall. It was followed by a worldwide release, including IMAX screenings. It was released in the United States and Canada on 6 November, and received fairly positive reviews from critics who praised the movie's action sequences, cinematography, acting and musical score, but criticized the screenplay and pacing. The theme song "Writing's on the Wall", performed and co-written by Sam Smith, won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song. "Spectre" grossed over $880 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing movie of 2015 and the second-largest unadjusted total for the series after "Skyfall".
The next movie in the series, "No Time to Die", is set to be released on 2 April 2021, with Craig reprising his role for the fifth and last time and Cary Joji Fukunaga directing.

= = = NoSQL = = =
A very common programming language for accessing a database is called SQL. Many of these databases use the mathematical concept of relations to store the data. NoSQL is a term for databases that do not use relations, to store the data in the database. Relational databases have the benefit of being able to guarantee that all the data stored in the database is consistent. The drawback of this is that the cost of indexing the data grows with the amount of data. 
NoSQL approaches do not give strong guarantees about consistency, but they are able to better handle the situations where relational database systems have problems coping.
NoSQL is a non-relational DBMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoid joins, and is easy to scale.
The purpose of using a NoSQL database is for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs.
NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example, companies like twitter, Facebook, google collect terabytes of user data every single day.
NoSQL DBs could be grouped as follows, but these are archetypes rather than strict boundaries :

= = = McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II = = =
The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a single-engine ground-attack aircraft. It is the second generation of the Harrier Jump Jet family. It is capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL). The aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. It can hover like a helicopter but can also fly like a jet at near supersonic speeds. It is named after the a bird of prey. It is primarily used on light attack or multi-role missions. These range from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military. Another is the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.
The project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s. It was a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK). it was aimed at working on solving the problems of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to improve the Harrier's performance. The UK dropped out of the project in 1975.
Following the withdrawal of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft uses a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic changes. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar. This resulted in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but was not built. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.

= = = Pevensey = = =
Pevensey is a village and civil parish in the Wealden district of East Sussex, England. The main village is located 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Eastbourne, one mile (1.6 km) inland from Pevensey Bay. The settlement of Pevensey Bay forms part of the parish. It was here that William the Conqueror first landed on and invaded England in 1066 after crossing the English Channel from Normandy, France.
Name.
The name "Pevensey" was first recorded in 947 as "Pefenesea", meaning "River of [a man named] Pefen". It comes from the Anglo-Saxon personal name "Pefen" plus "eã", meaning "river". This is probably a reference to the now largely silted-up marshes.
History.
In the 290s the Romans built a fort at Pevensey, which they named Anderitum. In 471 Saxons attacked Pevensey and the fort was abandoned for centuries. When William the Conqueror invaded England in September 1066, he landed at Pevensey. The bay provided a safe haven for his fleet of 700 ships. The English army had been awaiting Duke William's arrival on the south coast all summer. With supplies running short King Harold allowed his soldiers to return home. When Harald Hardrada the king of Norway invaded northern England in late September, King Harold gathered his army and moved north to York, 250 miles away, to meet the invaders. William, meanwhile, moved his army and fleet to Hastings and built a castle while he awaited Harold and his army. 
After the Battle of Hastings the Roman fort at Pevensey was occupied by the Normans. It was given to Robert, Count of Mortain (William's half brother). Robert de Mortain built his castle there. The castle was besieged several times during the 11th–13th centuries. Queen Elizabeth I ordered that it be demolished but the order was ignored. As late as 1942 small additions were made to the castle for the defence of Britain. It became a lookout over the channel for German aircraft during World War II. Today the castle is in the upkeep of English Heritage.

= = = United States courts of appeals = = =
The United States courts of appeals (or circuit courts) are the appellate courts of the Federal judiciary of the United States. A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit. In some cases it decides appeals from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies.
Background.
The United States courts of appeals are considered among the most and courts in the United States. They have the ability to set legal precedent that affect millions of Americans. The United States courts of appeals have strong influence on U.S. law. The U.S. Supreme Court chooses to review less than 1% of the more than 10,000 cases filed with it ly. This means the United States courts of appeals makes the final decision in most federal cases. The Ninth Circuit in particular is very influential. It covers 20% of the American population.
There are currently 179 judges on the United States courts of appeals. These judges are d by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. They have lifetime tenure, earning an annual salary of $213,300. There are thirteen United States courts of appeals. There are other tribunals that have "Court of Appeals" in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. They hear appeals in court-martial cases. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reviews final decisions by the Board of Veterans' Appeals in the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Decisions of the United States courts of appeals have been published by the private company West Publishing in the "Federal Reporter" series since the courts were established. Only decisions that the courts choose for publication are included. The "unpublished" opinions (of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) are published separately in West's "Federal Appendix". They are also available in on-line databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw. More recently, court decisions are also available electronically on the official court websites. However, there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons.
U.S. Courts of appeals.
There are eleven ed circuits which are numbered one through eleven. The D.C. Circuit is the twelfth. The thirteenth court of appeals is the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It has nationwide jurisdiction over certain appeals based on their subject matter. All of the courts of appeals also hear appeals from some government agency decisions and rulemaking. The largest share of these cases heard by the D.C. Circuit. The Federal Circuit hears appeals from specialized trial courts.

The West Potomac Park is a park in Washington, D.C.. It is just west of the National Mall. It is home to some of Washington's most famous places, like the Jefferson Memorial, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the Tidal Basin. But, the park’s most famous attraction is cherry blossoms.
History.
Thousands of cherry trees bloom around the waters of the Tidal Basin, which reflect the trees’ images. The basin was created in the late 1800s to prevent the Potomac River from flooding. These pink and white flowers serve as a symbol of international friendship. 
The original cherry trees were a gift from Japan. On March 26, 1912, more than 3,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington. Most were planted around the Tidal Basin. But cherry trees were also planted near the Washington Monument and the White House.
The park service maintains West Potomac Park, and helps protect the cherry trees.
Cherry Blossom Festival.
It is a wonderful gift that is over 100 years old now. The 1912 gift from the people of Japan has grown to this 3,800 trees. The cherry blossoms also serve as a symbol of the beginning of springtime. The trees burst with colors of soft pink and white. The blossoming of the cherry blossoms every spring is sort of the great springtime celebration, not only in the District of Columbia but throughout the United States.
Every year, Washington celebrates the arrival of spring with a two-week Cherry Blossom Festival. More than 1.5 million people from around the world visit the nation’s capital during the festival. They all hope to see the cherry trees at their “peak bloom.” Park officials define "peak bloom" as the period when 70 percent of Washington’s most common cherry tree variety -- the Yoshino trees -- are blooming. Yoshino cherry trees are one of 12 types of cherry trees in Washington. Peak bloom lasts several days each year.
Experts begin making peak bloom predictions in February. Visitors make their travel plans to Washington based on these predictions.

Hurricane Laura was a deadly and destructive tropical cyclone. Hurricane Laura, the 1856 Last Island hurricane and Hurricane Ida are the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in Louisiana in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the strongest to affect Louisiana since Hurricane Camille brought category 5 winds to the rural southeast portion of the state. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major storm of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura formed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August 16, and formed into a tropical depression by August 20. On August 21, Laura strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm, and breaking 1995's Hurricane Luis's record by eight days.
Laura first moved over the Lesser Antilles and brushing Puerto Rico as a tropical storm. It made landfall in the resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, killing four people in the Dominican Republic and 31 in Haiti. The storm then moved over the entire island of Cuba, forcing the evacuation of more than 260,000 people. Then, the outer rainbands of Laura moved over parts of the Florida Keys and Southern Florida. It then moved over the warm Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before undergoing rapid intensification by August 26. Later that day, Laura became a major hurricane, and soon reached a peak intensity of , making it a Category 4 hurricane.
Then, just a couple of hours after reaching peak intensity, at 6:00 UCT on August 27, Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana just below peak intensity with 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 939 mbar, at the same wind speed of the 1856 Last Island hurricane. It was the 10th strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit the United States in terms of wind speed, killed 42 people in the U.S, and caused $19 billion in damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States and inland areas. After landfall, Laura weakened, falling to tropical storm status later in the day, and tropical depression status over Arkansas the next day. On August 29, Laura weakened to a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone over the East Coast. Overall, Laura caused $19.1 billion in damage and killed 81 people. Areas that were badly affected by Laura, mostly southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana, were badly affected by more flooding and strong winds during Hurricane Delta around six weeks later.

= = = Antarctic fur seal = = =
The Antarctic fur seal ("Arctocephalus gazella"), is a type of seal in the genus "Arctocephalus". Even though the name has Antarctic in it, it does not live in Antarctica. The Antarctic fur seal mostly lives in Subantarctic islands.
Description.
Adult males are dark brown in colour. Females and young ones tend to be paler, almost grey with lighter undersides. Young ones are dark brown at birth, almost black in color.
Males are larger than females. Males can grow up to 2 m (6.5 ft) long. Males can also weigh 133 kg (293 lb). Females can grow up to 1.4 m (4.6 ft) long. Females can weight 34 kg (74.9 lb).

= = = Sarah Emma Edmonds = = =
Sarah Emma Edmonds (December 1841 – September 5, 1898), was a Canadian woman who claimed to have served as a man as a nurse and spy with the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1992, she was enlisted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.
In 1864, Boston publisher DeWolfe, Fiske, &amp; Co. published her account of her military experiences as "The Female Spy of the Union Army".
Born in 1841 in New Brunswick, at that point a British settlement, Edmonds grew up with her sisters on their family's homestead close to Magaguadavic Lake, not a long way from the State of Maine. Edmonds fled home at age fifteen to get away from a planned marriage and the maltreatment of her dad, who needed a child rather than a girl. Supported by her mother, who herself married young, Edmonds got away from the marriage and pretended to be a man to travel more easily. A male mask let Edmonds eat, travel, and work freely. Edmonds worked selling Bibles door to door. for a Bible book retailer and distributer in Hartford, Connecticut.
Her enthusiasm was started by a book she read in her childhood by Maturin Murray Ballou called "Fanny Campbell, the Female Pirate Captain", telling the story of Fanny Campbell on a privateer transport during the American Revolution while dressed as a man. Fanny stayed dressed as a man so as to seek after different experiences, to which Edmonds credits her longing to dress in drag. During the Civil War, on May 25, 1861, she enrolled in Company F of the second Michigan Infantry, otherwise called the Flint Union Grays. Later she masked herself as a man named "Franklin Flint Thompson," named after Flint, Michigan. She felt that it was her obligation to serve her nation. She from the start filled in as a male field nurse in campaigns under General McClellan, including the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, the Peninsula Campaign, Vicksburg, Fredericksburg, and others. 
She had an opportunity during the war when a Union spy in Richmond, Virginia was found and shot, and a companion, James Vesey, was executed in a snare. She exploited the open spot and the chance to vindicate her companion's demise. She applied for, and won, the situation as Franklin Thompson. There is no proof in her military records that she actually served as a spy, but there is plenty about it in her book.
Making a trip into hostile area to assemble data required many disguises.. One camouflage required Edmonds to utilize silver nitrate to color her skin dark, wear a dark hairpiece, and stroll into the Confederacy masked as an individual of color by the name of Cuff. Some other time she entered as an Irish vendor lady by the name of Bridget O'Shea, guaranteeing that she was offering apples and cleanser to the officers. Once more, she was "working for the Confederates" as a dark laundress when a bundle of authentic papers dropped out of an official's coat. At the point when Thompson came back to the Union with the papers, the commanders were enchanted. Some other time, she filled in as an investigator in Kentucky as Charles Mayberry, revealing a Confederacy operator.
Edmonds' profession as Frank Thompson came to an end when she traveled to Berry's Brigade so as to convey mail to Union powers. While trying to take an easy route, she was tossed into a ditch by her donkey and injured. In 1863, she contracted malaria. She thought if she went to a military emergency clinic she would be found out. She went to a private medical clinic, expecting to come back to military life once she had recovered. Then she saw banners posting Frank Thompson as a deserter. She chose to fill in as a female nurse at a Washington, D.C. clinic for injured troopers run by the United States Christian Commission. 
In 1882, Edmonds began the process of clearing the charge of desertion from Thompson's record in order to receive a pension. She got a pension of $12 a month.

According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August. As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars. 
The USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies. These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga
nizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes.

It has also been stated that specialty-crop farmers have not been helped enough by the program.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Namibia is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). 
Early cases.
The Minister of Health and Social Services, Dr. Kalumbi Shangula, announced on 14 March 2020 that the virus had reached Namibia. A Romanian couple constituted the two first cases and recovered after 79 days after their initial diagnosis.
On 17 March 2020, President Hage Geingob declared a which caused the closure of all borders, suspension of gatherings and economic related resolutions. 
No infections were reported from 6 April 2020 to 20 May 2020, however there was a notable increase in cases after this period - possibly due to local transmission.
Cases total.
As of August 2020, Namibia was within the top 20 number of countries with the most COVID-19 cases reported in Africa. 
A total of 166 health care workers tested positive for the virus, increasing the pressure on the health system given that a shortage of health care workers existed even before the pandemic.
Quarantine.
On 31 July, the Health Minister announced a small end in quarantine protocols that would account for faster recovery rates. Patients with a positive COVID-19 result will automatically be regarded as recovered 10 days after their infection, given that they do not display symptoms anymore.
Vaccination campaign.
Vaccinations started on 19 March 2021, initially with 100,000 doses of the donated by China and 24,000 doses of the purchased through COVAX.

= = = Run out = = =
A run out is a way of getting a batter out in cricket. It involves hitting a wicket with the ball when no batsman is in the ground of that wicket; the batsman who is out is the one who is nearest to that ground, or if both batsmen are in a ground, the batsman who reached that ground second. Run outs can happen when batters are trying to score runs by running between the two grounds.
Mankading.
When a bowler is readying himself to bowl, the ball becomes live; if the nonstriker leaves the ground at the bowler's end before the bowler has thrown the ball, then the bowler can hit the wicket in this ground with the ball to "mankad" the nonstriker.
Stumping.
A stumping is a special type of run out in which the wicketkeeper (the fielder with gloves behind the striking batter) hits the wicket in the ground at the striker's end with the ball when the striker is out of that ground.
Stumpings are not allowed on no-balls; a striker who is not trying to run can only be run out on a no-ball if the wicketkeeper has another fielder help him.

= = = Bowled = = =
In cricket, a batter can be out bowled if the bowler delivers the ball to the batter and it hits the wicket behind the batter before touching anyone other than the batter. When the wicket is hit, one of its 5 sticks must fall to the ground for the batter to be out. A batter can't be bowled if the ball was not delivered legally.
A batter can also be out leg before wicket (LBW) if they use their body to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.

= = = Pseudorandom number generator = = =
A pseudorandom number generator is a way that computers generate numbers. "There is no known way for a computer to generate numbers which are truly random". A computer algorithm can generate numbers which look random.
An analogy is a jar of (numbered) marbles. Humans can reach into the jar and grab "random" marbles. However, to understand pseudo random numbers, we must understand that this process is not random. We decided to reach into the bag based off of our brain giving us a signal to reach in this way, and the marbles themselves being arranged in a certain way.
Pseudo-random number generators are computer routines which tell the computer how to produce a number which "looks" random.
The initial position of the marbles is called the "seed." The seed is used to create the randomness. To come up with the seed some programs use time of day, while others convert background noise into a number.
When you need to get the next random number ("marble") the generator calculates it with some algorithm. It is based on the previous generated number, in turn, depending on the initial "seed." The algorithm is strict, it will always produce the same sequence of random numbers ("marbles") given the same initial "seed".

= = = Alexander Taraikovsky = = =
Alexander Taraikovsky (26 March 1986 – 10 August 2020) was a participant in protests against the false numbers of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. He was shot dead point-blank (from a very close range) by special forces officers on August 10, 2020, in Minsk. The government-run media tried to present it as something that happened through his own carelessness (failure to take the care that a cautious person usually takes).
He was shot by the police on the evening of August 10, 2020, near Pushkinskaya metro station in Minsk. 
He was buried at Western cemetery in Minsk on August 15, 2020. The death of Taraikovsky caused more protests.
On December 21, 2020, the representative of the public initiative "Belarusian People's Tribunal" Igor Makar published the materials of the preliminary investigation. They claimed that Aleksandr Taraikovsky was deliberately and cynically killed by an employee of the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit "Almaz" Korovin Nikita Yuryevich ( born in 1993), with the complicity of other unidentified employees of this special forces unit.
On February 2, 2021, TUT.BY got the results of the audio test of the recording made by BYPOL. Nikolai Karpenkov the chief of GUBOPiK (a special police unit in Belarus) is heard to say that he was shot by the police. The expert test made it clear that the Nikolai Karpenkov's voice is on the record and there are no signs of changes made to it.
Reaction.
On September 17, 2020, European Parliament spoke on the situation in Belarus. It printed a decision, supported by many people in the parliament, calling for an "independent and effective investigation" into the death of Alexander Taraikovsky related to the protests.
On November 19, 2020, Jim Gilmore, United States Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, spoke on a three-month end of the investigation into the death of Alexander Taraikovsky. He said that it is another sign of “the impunity with which Belarusian security forces pursue their violent crackdown on peaceful protesters.”

= = = Bluestar's Prophecy = = =
Bluestar's Prophecy is a teen fantasy novel in the "Warriors" series by Erin Hunter. This is the second "Warriors" "Super Edition" (a standalone story that is longer than most "Warriors" books). The main character is a cat named Bluestar. The book tells her life story, from her birth to the day she becomes leader of a group of cats called ThunderClan. It was published by HarperCollins and released on 28 July 2009.
Plot.
Bluestar is called Bluekit, Bluepaw, and Bluefur during different parts of her life.
"Bluestar's Prophecy" follows the life of Bluestar, the leader of ThunderClan. The book starts with a prologue that recounts Bluestar's death in "A Dangerous Path". The book then goes back to Bluestar's childhood, during which Goosefeather, the Clan's medicine cat, receives a prophecy about Bluepaw being a fire that will blaze through the forest, but who will be destroyed by water. A few moons later, Bluepaw's mother, Moonflower, is killed in a battle.
Bluestar's childhood is defined by her relationship with her sister, Snowfur, which is damaged when Snowfur falls in love with Thistleclaw, whom Bluefur finds arrogant and untrustworthy. Snowfur is later killed when she is hit by a car, leaving a heartbroken Bluefur to care for Snowfur's son, Whitekit.
Bluefur later meets a RiverClan warrior named Oakheart, and although they do not like each other at first, they eventually fall in love. They decide to spend one night together, but agree that for the good of their Clans, they will never meet again afterwards. One moon later, Bluefur is horrified to find out that she is expecting kittens. Thrushpelt, a ThunderClan warrior with feelings for Bluefur, offers to help her take care of her kits. Bluefur accepts his offer, allowing the rest of ThunderClan to believe that Thrushpelt is the father of her kits.
Sunstar, ThunderClan's leader, tells Bluefur that he was planning to make her ThunderClan's new deputy (second-in-command), but because of her kittens, he will promote Thistleclaw to deputy instead. After having a vision of Thistleclaw drenched in blood, Bluefur realizes that allowing him to become deputy and then leader would be deadly to the Clan. She decides to take her three kits to Oakheart and let them be raised in RiverClan. During this, one of her kits, Mosskit, freezes to death. Her other kits, Mistykit and Stonekit, make it to RiverClan. She explains the disappearance of her kits by pretending they have been taken by a starving fox.
Without her kits, Bluefur is made deputy. After Sunstar dies, she becomes leader, taking on the name Bluestar. After successfully leading ThunderClan for several seasons, she receives a prophecy from the ThunderClan medicine cat (healer), Spottedleaf: “Fire alone can save our Clan.” Later, while walking by a human town, she catches sight of a bright ginger house cat named Rusty. Recognizing him as the cat from Spottedleaf's prophecy, she names him Firepaw and takes him into ThunderClan.

Yellowfang's Secret is a teen fantasy novel written by Cherith Baldry under the pen name Erin Hunter. It is the fifth "Super Edition" in the "Warriors" novel series. "Yellowfang's Secret" was first released in hardcover on 9 October 2012. It focuses on a cat named Yellowfang, who lives with forest cats who call themselves Clans.
"Yellowfang's Secret" follows Yellowfang, the ThunderClan medicine cat (healer), during her early life in ShadowClan. Yellowfang trains as a warrior apprentice (a cat who hunts and fights), but realizes that she would do better as a medicine cat. The story in the book takes place at the same time as the other Super Editions "Bluestar's Prophecy" and "Crookedstar's Promise". It is written for readers 8-12 years old.
Plot.
Yellowfang is called Yellowkit when she is born. She is born in ShadowClan. Her parents are Brightflower and Brackenfoot. Her siblings are Nutkit and Rowankit. Yellowfang has a special power: she feels other cats' pain as if it were hers. When she is small, both she and Nutkit have pain in their stomach one day, even though Nutkit is the only one who is really sick.
When Yellowkit is older, she is renamed Yellowpaw. A cat named Deerleap teaches her how to be a warrior, where she will hunt and fight for her Clan. She becomes close with a cat called Raggedpelt. The other cats do not like Raggedpelt because the think his father might have been a house cat (Clan cats do not like house cats because they think they are lazy). Yellowpaw tries to help Raggedpelt find out who his father was. But when they find out his father really was a house cat, things become worse for Raggedpelt. Hal, Raggedpelt's father, rejects Raggedpelt, and then Raggedpelt kills Hal. Another female cat, Foxheart, also likes Raggedpelt, but Raggedpelt likes Yellowpaw.
Yellowpaw is eventually renamed Yellowfang, and she completes her training and becomes a warrior. Sagewhisker, the ShadowClan medicine cat, convinces Yellowfang that her ability to feel other cats' pain would make her a very good medicine cat. At first, Yellowfang wants to stay as a warrior instead, but later she changes her mind. Yellowfang becomes Sagewhisker's apprentice and takes the medicine cat's vows. In this book, being a medicine cat means never having a mate or kittens. But Yellowfang stays with Raggedpelt in secret, against the rules.
Yellowfang finds out that she is pregnant. Because this is against the medicine cat rules, Yellowfang gives birth in secret. Only one kitten survives. She names the kitten Brokenkit and gives it to Raggedpelt. The Clan thinks Foxheart is Brokenkit's mother. However, he is nursed by a cat named Lizardstripe, who is mean to him. Her kittens also bully him. Brokenkit grows up angry and misguided. Eventually, Brokenkit becomes a warrior and is renamed Brokentail. He eventually becomes the deputy (second-in-command) of the Clan. Brokentail trains the young cats of his Clan harshly. When Raggedpelt (who has become leader of ShadowClan and is now called Raggedstar) tells Brokentail it is too much, Brokentail pretends to agree, but seceretly plans to kill him, so that he can become leader of the Clan. Brokentail's plan works, and he makes it look like cats from another Clan, WindClan, killed Raggedpelt.
Brokentail becomes Brokenstar. He rules ShadowClan cruelly. Using his father's death as an excuse, he has ShadowClan attack WindClan, eventually driving them out. He begins training kittens before they are six months old, which is against the rules the Clans live by. He tells old cats to leave the camp and fend for themselves, which is also against the Clan's rules. When a kitten dies in battle, Yellowfang speaks up against Brokenstar's cruelty, which leads Brokenstar to set up another plan: falsely accusing her of the deaths of two other kittens, and banishing her from the Clan.
Yellowfang leaves and she goes to ThunderClan territory, where, exhausted by rage and hunger, she is attacked by a ThunderClan cat named Firepaw. After a brief fight, Yellowfang admits defeat. Yellowfang is taken to the ThunderClan camp, where she slowly comes to love ThunderClan, and is eventually invited to stay there for good.
A bonus comic scene at the end of the book shows Yellowfang killing Brokenstar with a poisonous berry, in an attempt to put right everything she has done wrong in her life.

The movement is similar to free software movement but focuses on all art works, e.g. images or songs. Some free cultural works are for example the movie Big Buck Bunny or files at Wikimedia Commons. Wikipedia is also part of free culture because it uses a free license for its articles.
The rules.
Works, for example movies, that respect free culture are called "free cultural works" or simply "free works". These works have to allow anyone to:
The artist who creates something can make it free by adding a free license to it. Most famous free licenses are Creative Commons (CC) licenses.

= = = Urban morphology = = =
Urban morphology is the field of research, study, study, and design of the form of human settlement and the process of their formation and change.

Usually the analysis of the physical form focuses on the pattern of the street, the plot (or for example in UK "the plot") and the building patterns. Land use analysis specifically is usually conducted using cartographic sources and the development process is derived from a comparison of historical maps. Special attention is paid to how the physical shape of a city changes over time and how different cities compare to each other. Another significant part of this research profession deals with the study of the social forms that are expressed in the physical arrangement of a city, and vice versa, how the physical form produces or recreates various social forms.

= = = Olfactores = = =
Olfactores is a group, called a clade, in taxonomy. Taxonomy is the way scientists put living things in groups to show how they are related to each other. Olfactores is part of the phylum Chordata, animals with notochords. These are rods of tissue that form inside the developing embryo. In many organisms, the notochord helps the spine or nervous system grow, but some animals have only a notochord and no spinal bones. Olfactores contains Vetulicolia, Tunicata (Urochordata) and Vertebrata (also named Craniata). Most animals in Chordata are also in Olfactores. Only the animals in Cephalochordata are in Chordata but not Olfactores.
Scientists started to think taxonomy needed a special name for this group of living things in 2006. They studied large numbers of data and saw a pattern that said the organisms in Olfactores had a relationship with each other that they did not have with cephalochordates. The name "olfactores" comes from Latin word "olfactus" for "sense of smell." Scientists named this clade "Olfactores" because the animals in it grow a pharynx as part of their respiratory system and use it to breathe. Cephalochordates, for example the lancelet, do not have respiratory systems and they do not have any organs whose job is only to smell things.

Davies' tree frog tadpoles are different from other tadpoles. Their mouths have no beaks or teeth.
There are fewer Davies' tree frogs than there were. The IUCN Red List says they are a vulnerable species. Scientists say there are fewer Davies' tree frogs because human beings have changed their places where they live from forests, because of predators, and because there are not enough Davies' tree frogs in one place for them to find unrelated partners and make healthy offspring.

= = = INaturalist = = =
iNaturalist is an American website where people post scientific information about plants, animals and other living things. Usually, they send photographs of which living things they saw and say where and when they saw them.
iNaturalist works by crowdsourcing, by asking many, many people to work on the project. Some of the people who send information to iNaturalist are professional scientists and some are citizen scientists, ordinary people who want to help scientific projects. iNaturalist sends information to International Union for the Conservation of Nature and other projects that watch endangered animals and other populations. iNaturalist users can help park rangers and other people who work in forests find and identify invasive species, for example kudzu. According to one park ranger from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the United States, rangers usually already know an invasive plant is in their park, but iNaturalist and programs like it help them find out exactly where it is. Then they can gather people to remove it.
Parks, conservation programs and research teams in many countries have used iNaturalist, for example the United States, Canada and New Zealand.
History.
Students at the University of California at Berkeley founded iNaturalist in 2008. It was a master's thesis project. Since 2014, the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society have run iNaturalist together.
Platform.
People use their smart phones to look at or send information to iNaturalist, usually photographs. Then other users on the website figure out what the is in the picture.
Seek.
In 2020, iNaturalist launched a smaller program called Seek. Users with Seek can point their phones at a plant or animal and the program will try to tell them its name. According to iNature's Tony Iwane, "Seek's machine-learning model is based entirely on observations from . . the iNaturalist community, so it's really the hard work of thousands and thousands of people on iNaturalist that enables Seek to function."

= = = The Simpsons (season 2) = = =
The 2nd season of The Simpsons first started showing on the Fox network from October 11, 1990 to July 11, 1991. It has 22 episodes. The season started with the episode "Bart Gets an "F"" and ended with "Blood Feud". The season was first put on DVD for Region 1 on August 6, 2002, Region 2 on July 8, 2002, and Region 4 on July 24, 2002. The season's executive producers were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon. They were the executive producers for the first season. The episode "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" won a Primetime Emmy Award.
Production.
"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" was the first episode made in the season. "Bart Gets an "F"" was broadcast first because Bart Simpson was liked by many people in 1990. The 2nd season had a new opening sequence. It was shorter than the one before (which was about 90 seconds). In the opening sequence before, it showed Bart taking a bus stop sign. The opening sequence in the 2nd season shows Bart skateboarding past characters that were shown in the first season. There were three opening sequences made for this season. One was 75 seconds, one was 45 seconds, and one was 25 seconds. This was done so that editors of "The Simpsons" could do more with the length of each episode.
Many new characters were first shown in this season: Mayor Quimby, Kang and Kodos, Maude Flanders, Bill and Marty, Dr. Hibbert, Roger Meyers, Jr., Sideshow Mel, Lionel Hutz, Dr. Nick Riviera, the Blue Haired Lawyer, Rainier Wolfcastle, Troy McClure, Groundskeeper Willie, Hans Moleman, Professor Frink, and Comic Book Guy.
Ratings.
After the first season, Fox moved showings of "The Simpsons" from Sundays to Thursday so that more people would see it. It was to be shown on 8:00 PM, which started competition with "The Cosby Show". Producers of "The Simpsons" thought that the competition would make their ratings lower. In the summer of 1990, many news companies made stories about the competition. In this time, NBC had 208 television stations. Fox only had 133. 
"Bart Gets an "F"" (the first episode of the season) got almost the same Neilsen rating as "The Cosby Show". The episode got a rating of 18.4 and "The Cosby Show" got a rating of 18.5. "Bart Gets an "F"" was watched by 33.6 million people, which was more than the "Cosby Show". It was the most watched show on that week. In that time, it was the most watched episode on the Fox network ever. The next episode ("Simpson and Delilah") got a Nielsen rating of 16.2, and "The Cosby Show" got a rating of 18.5 again. "Simpson and Delilah" also had more people who watched it when it was first shown. 
The 3rd episode ("Treehouse of Horror") did not get as many people to watch it as "The Cosby Show" did. After that, "The Cosby Show" had higher ratings than most of the other episode of "The Simpsons" 2nd season. "Three Men and a Comic Book" was the only episode of this season to get a higher Neilsen rating than "The Cosby Show" did. That episode was 23rd and "The Cosby Show" was 26th in the ratings for that week. "The Simpsons" did not get higher ratings again until in the 3rd season with the episode "Homer at the Bat". "The Simpsons" stopped showing on Thursdays in the 6th season.

= = = The Book of the City of Ladies = = =
The Book of the City of Ladies or Le Livre de la Cité des Dames (published in 1405), is perhaps Christine de Pizan's most famous literary work. Pizan originally wrote Le Livre de la Cité des Dames in Middle French but it was later translated into English (1999). The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun's popular "Roman de la Rose". Pizan combats Meun's statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies. She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous women throughout history. These women are "housed" in the City of Ladies, which is an imaginary city from the book. As Pizan builds her city, she uses each famous woman as a building block for the walls and houses of the city. Each woman added to the city adds to Pizan's argument towards women as valued participants in society. She also advocates in favour of education for woman.
Summary.
Part I.
Part I opens with Christine reading from Matheolus's Lamentations, a work from the thirteenth century that addresses marriage wherein the author writes that women make men's lives miserable. Upon reading these words, Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman. The three Virtues then appear to Christine, and tell her that she has been chosen by god to create a city for woman.
Part II.
In Part II, Lady Rectitude says she will help Christine "construct the houses and buildings inside the walls of the City of Ladies" and fill it with inhabitants who are "valiant ladies of great renown". As they build, Lady Rectitude tells Christine stories of powerful woman that will be housed inside the city. Lady Rectitude also refutes allegations that women are unchaste, inconstant, unfaithful, and mean by nature through her stories. This part closes with Christine addressing women and asking them to pray for her as she continues her work with Lady Justice to complete the city.
Part III.
In Part III, Lady Justice joins with Christine to "add the finishing touches" to the city, including bringing a queen to rule the city. Lady Justice tells Christine of female saints who were praised for their martyrdom. At the close of this part, Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of the City of Ladies. She beseeches them to defend and protect the city and to follow their queen (the Virgin Mary). She also warns the women against the lies of slanderers, saying, "Drive back these treacherous liars who use nothing but tricks and honeyed words to steal from you that which you should keep safe above all else: your chastity and your glorious good name".
A few women who were mentioned include:
Medusa, Helen of Troy, Polyxena, Florence of Rome, Isabeau of Bavaria, Joan of Armagnac, Margaret of Bavaria, Isis, Marie, Duchess of Auvergne, Margaret of Burgundy, Duchess of Bavaria, Marie of Savoy, Countess of Saint-Pol, Anne de Bourbon and The Virgin Mary.

= = = Australian lace-lid = = =
The Australian lace-lid, Day's big-eyed tree frog or lace-eyed tree frog ("Ranoidea dayi") is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in northeastern Queensland.
The adult frog is 5.0 cm long. Unlike other male frogs, which can sing in groups, male Australian lace-lids are always at least 1 metre apart from each other when they sing. Scientists think that the males compete against each other for the females, that they are territorial animals.
This frog lives in rainforests, especially mountain rainforests. It will eat almost anything it can catch, usually invertebrates, for example spiders and insects. Its large eyes help it hunt at night.
The female frog lays eggs under rocks in streams where the water flows fast. The eggs are clear and 3.3 to 3.5 mm in diameter. The tadpoles have strong tails so they can swim in the fast water. The tadpoles eat algae on the bottom of the stream. Tadpoles that hatch early become frogs in 3-4 months. Tadpoles that hatch in the fall may stay tadpoles through the winter and become frogs the next year.
Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered. One idea is that feral pigs have come to their rainforests and rip up the low plants that the frog likes to climb on and hide in. Another idea is that the fugal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing these frogs.

= = = Kolkhoz = = =
Kolkhoz (, a contraction of ������������ ���������, "collective ownership", kollektivnoye khozaystvo) is the name given to large farms that existed in the Soviet Union, and that were organised as a cooperative. A group of people would run these farms; they also owned the means of production (like the machines they needed), but not the land, which was owned by the state. 
The state also ran farms during that time, which were known as Sovkhoz. These farms existed from about 1917, the date of the October Revolution, to 1991, when the Soviet Union was disbanded. In a Sovkhoz, people were employed, and did not own any means of production. 
As a collective farm, a "kolkhoz" was legally organized as a production cooperative. The Standard Charter of a kolkhoz is a model of cooperative principles in print. It speaks of the kolkhoz as a "form of agricultural production cooperative of peasants that voluntarily unite for the purpose of joint agricultural production based on [...] collective labor". It asserts that "the kolkhoz is managed according to the principles of socialist self-management, democracy, and openness, with active participation of the members in decisions concerning all aspects of internal life".
They imposed detailed work programs and nominated their preferred managerial candidates. Since the mid-1930s, the kolkhozes had been in effect an offshoot of the state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. As a result, many kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to "sovkhozes". The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev's administration authorized a guaranteed wage to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees. Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.

Cohabitation is an arrangement where people who are romantically or sexually attracted to each other live together, without being married.

In these countries, a percentage of children are born outside marriage.

= = = Wyoming toad = = =
The Wyoming toad or Baxter's toad ("Anaxyrus baxteri") is a toad that has become rare. The only living Wyoming toads are in captivity. For example, the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming breeds these toads. It was listed as "endangered" in 1984, and as "extinct in the wild" in 1991. There were suddenly far fewer Wyoming toads around 1975 and the toad extremely rare by 1980. To prevent extinction, a captive breeding program was started in 1989 at the Thorne Williams Unit. This program produced enough young toads in the first few years to send toads to seven different zoos. In 1998, the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery received toads to breed. Between 1995 and 2006, when the remaining captive toads were moved from the Thorne Williams Unit to the Red Buttes Environmental Biology Laboratory south of Laramie, nearly 46,000 offspring had been produced at the Thorne Williams Unit and released back into the wild. Before the sharp declines occurred, this toad was classified as a subspecies of the Canadian toad.
In nature, the female toad leaves her eggs in the shallow parts of ponds and lakes. The tadpoles swim in the warmest parts of the water.
Adult frogs look for food during the day and hide at night. Sometimes they go into burrows dug by rodents. Adult frogs eat mostly ants but they also eat beetles and other animals without backbones.
Scientists are not sure why the Wyoming toad started to die out in the 1970s. They think it might have been that people were using an insect-killing chemical called Baytex, that seagulls, pelicans and raccoons were eating the toads, or that irrigation for hay growing changed their living space.

= = = Ten Little Indians = = =
The Ten Little Indians is an American nursery rhyme. The term "Indians" in this sense refers to the Native Americans in the United States.
The modern lyrics for this song are:
Minstrel song.
Songwriter Septimus Winner created an elaborated version of the children's song, called "Ten Little Injuns", in 1868 for a minstrel show.
Books and songs.
It is generally thought the song was adapted, possibly by Frank J. Green in 1869 as "Ten Little Niggers". It's also possible, however, that the influence was the other way around, with "Ten Little Niggers" being a close reflection of the text which then became "Ten Little Indians". 
Agatha Christie's book, "And Then There Were None", was first called "Ten Little Niggers" and then "Ten Little Indians".
Criticism of the racist language.
Due to the use of racist words, modern versions for children usually use "soldier boys" or "teddy bears" as objects in the rhyme.
References in popular culture.
"Ten Little Indians" is a 1962 pop and rock-n-roll song from the Beach Boys. It's on their studio album "Surfin' Safari".
Several "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" short films used the song. In "Tom Tom Tomcat", Tweety sings the song while writing down the number of Indian cats Granny has taken down so far.
In England's "Mickey Mouse Annual" No. 6, the song was adapted into the comic "10 Little Mickey Kids". It told of little mouse babies who met their end until there were two left.

= = = 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill = = =
The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was a proposed bill in Hong Kong. It would have changed a law that was already there, the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Cap. 503) in relation to special submission arrangements and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (Cap. 525). It would have changed the way the government of Hong Kong asked for people to be arrested in any other part of the People's Republic of China, namely mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan, with which it did not already have an existing law. The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was never passed.
Background.
Early in 2018, a 19-year-old Hong Kong resident was arrested in Taiwan for killing his 20-year-old girlfriend. He was tried in Taiwan because the government of Hong Kong had no way to extradite him, to formally ask the government of Taiwan to send him to them as a prisoner. Because of this, people started talking about Hong Kong's criminal law.
In February 2019, the government proposed a change to criminal laws. The law is meant to allow a the government of Hong Kong to arrest anyone suspected of a crime and send them to places where it does not already have a formal extradition treaty, such as mainland China, Macau and Taiwan.
However, organizations like Amnesty International and many Hong Kongers saw that the law could also be used in another way. The law could allow the government to arrest almost any Hong Konger suspected of a crime and send them to be tried in mainland China instead of in Hong Kong. Mainland China has a reputation for unfair trials. They worried that the government would use this to arrest Hong Kongers who spoke against the mainland government and bring them to China as political prisoners and scare the people of Hong Kong.
The government stopped trying to pass the bill on June 15 and formally withdrew it on October 23, 2019.
Legacy.
This bill was one of the reasons Hong Kongers protested in the 2019 Hong Kong protests.

Health and death.
In October 2009, it was reported that Subzero might need to be put down as the medication he needed for his arthritis became unavailable in Australia. However the medication was subsequently sourced from the United States, and Subzero continued to appear in public. In his retirement he was gentle natured, very patient with children and remained with Graham Salisbury until Salisbury's death in June 2020.
On 29 August 2020, he was humanely put down due to a heart condition. He was 31.

= = = Chalcid wasp = = =
The chalcid wasps are formally called the Chalcidoidea. They are a superfamily of parasitoid wasps. They have a huge number of species, estimated as over 500,000 (half a million). The superfamily includes 22 families. The data included morphology and ribosomal 18S data. The researchers comment that only about 22,506 species of the half-million have been formally described.
Most of the species are parasitic on other kinds of insect. They attack the egg or larval stages of at least 12 different insect orders. When that insect is itself a parasitoid, then the chalcid is called a hyperparasitoid. Chalcids are sometimes used to control crop pests. A few chalcids actually eat plants, and the most famous of these are the fig wasps.
There are 19 living families of chalcids.

A hyperparasite is a parasite (or parasitoid) which is parasitic on another parasite. Usually, this means it is parasitic on the larval stage of the victim species.
Typical examples are members of the Apocrita, and some species in two other insect orders, the Diptera (true flies) and Coleoptera (beetles). Seventeen families in the Hymenoptera and a few species of Diptera and Coleoptera are hyperparasitic. 
Primary parasitism in the Hymenoptera evolved in the Jurassic period about 135 million years ago. 
In literature.
Jonathan Swift refers to hyperparasitism in these lines from his poem "On Poetry: A Rhapsody":
So nat'ralists observe, a flea
Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller fleas to bite 'em.
And so proceeds "ad infinitum".
Number of levels.
Three levels of parasitism have been seen in fungi (a fungus on a fungus on a fungus on a tree).

= = = Least weasel = = =
The least weasel ("Mustela nivalis") is the world's smallest mammalian carnivore. It is the smallest member of the genus "Mustela", the smallest member of the family Mustelidae and the order Carnivora. 
It is also called the little weasel or common weasel. 
The weasel is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa. It has been introduced to New Zealand, Malta, Crete, Bermuda, Madeira Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, São Tomé, the Falkland Islands, Argentina and Chile. It is a least concern species.
Description.
The least weasel has a thin, long and very flexible body. It has a small, long, head. The legs and tail are short. The feet have sharp, dark-coloured claws and a lot of hairs on the bottom. Its eyes are small when compared to their head size. Its eyes are dark colored.
The legs and tail are relatively short. The tail makes up less than half the body length.
Males have an average length of long. Females have an average length of long. Males weigh . Females weigh .
Territorial and social behaviour.
Male least weasels have territories that include many female territories. The number of least weasels in each territory depends on the amount of food and reproductive success. The male least weasel has a bigger territory during spring or when there is less food. It uses faeces and urine to mark its territory. The least weasel does not dig its own den, but stays in the burrows that other animals have left, like a mole or rat.
Breeding.
The least weasel mates from April to July. The gestation period is 34 to 37 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, the least weasel usually give birth to 6 kits. Kit is the name for baby weasels. The least weasel is able to reproduce by the age of three to four months.
The female takes care of its kits without help from the male. The kits weigh . Newborn kits are born pink, naked, blind and deaf. They will have a white coat of downy fur at the age of four days. The first teeth come out at the age of two to three weeks. They start to eat solid food at that time.
The eyes and ears open at the age of at three to four weeks. By eight weeks they learn how to kill the animals that they eat. The young ones leave the family after nine to twelve weeks. Least weasels can live for seven or eight years.
Feeding.
The least weasel mostly eats rodents, for example mice, hamsters, and gerbils. It usually does not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are almost never eaten. It can attack adult pikas and gerbils. Least weasels sometimes kill prey larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel grouse and hares. In England, the least weasel likes to eat the field vole.
Even though it is small, the least weasel is a great hunter. It is able to kill a rabbit five to 10 times its own weight. Even though they are commonly eaten, the rabbits are usually young ones. Rabbits become a very important source of food during the spring, when there are few small rodents.
Predators.
Red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecats, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards are predators of the least weasel. Owls are very good at catching least weasels. Some of the owls that hunt least weasels include barn owls, barred owls, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey that eat the least weasel include broad-winged buzzards and rough-legged buzzards. Some types of snake may eat the least weasel. They include the black rat snake and the copperhead.
Disease and parasites.
Ectoparasites also target weasels. Common ones are different species of lice, mites and fleas. Very often, weasels get the parasites from the nests or burrows of their prey. Certain species of nematode also infect weasels.
Distribution.

= = = I. L. Patterson = = =
Isaac Lee "Ike" Patterson, (September 17, 1859 - December 21, 1929) was a Republican Governor of Oregon from 1927 to 1929. 
Early life.
Patterson was born on his family's "King's Valley" estate in Rural Benton County, Oregon September 17, 1859. His parrents were emigrants to the Oregon Territory, having made the overland trip from their previous home of Bellvue, Illinois. Until he reached the age of 18, he worked his father's farm. He later attended Monmouth's Christian College, for one year. Patterson supported himself as a grocery clerk in Independence, later earning his way into a position there as a business partner. His participation in the grocery store would last for 22 years.
Entry into politics.
In 1898, Patterson entered politics, gaining election to a seat in the Oregon State Senate representing Marion County. At the time, he was one of the youngest State Legislators ever elected, having been sworn in at age 32. President William McKinley appointed Patterson to the post of Collector of Customs, Portland District in 1898, and was reappointed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, serving there until 1906.
In 1899, Patterson sold off his share in the grocery store, and purchased a 300 acre ranch in rural Polk County. The farm would prove profitable, and paved the way for Patterson's later venture into a successful wool and hide business in Portland.
After serving out his term as Collector of Customs, Patterson managed his business affairs and kept workinng politicaly inside the Republican Party. In 1918, the citizens of Benton and Polk Counties elected him to represent their district, returning him to the State Senate. In the Senate, he moved his way up and served as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Governorship.
Patterson attempted to secure the Republican nomination for Governor in 1922, coming in a distant third in the primary in a six-man race. Despite this poor showing, Patterson had strong ties with the party's old guard. He won the Chairmanship of the Oregon State Republican Party Central Committee in 1924, going on to chair Calvin Coolidge's Presidential campaign in Oregon.
His profile statewide rose, and this secured him the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1926. He would go on to defeat Walter M. Price in that year's general election.
Using President Coolidge as an inspiration, Governor Patterson would govern the state in a financialy conservative manner; streamlining agencies of the state and vetoing legislation which would threaten balancing the state's finances. By 1920, the state balanced its budget for the first time in its history.
His administration notably continued improving state roads and highways, established the state's system of higher education, and directed the state prison system to house adult and juvinile criminals seperately.
He was considered a popular and well-respected figure by rivals and supporters alike, but suddenly died in office of Pneumonia on December 21, 1929. 

= = = A. W. Norblad = = =
Albin Walter Norblad, Sr., (March 18, 1881-April 17, 1960) was a prominent citizen of Astoria, Oregon and the Republican Governor of Oregon from 1929 to 1931.
He was the father of Representative A. Walter Norblad (Albin Walter Norblad, Jr.), Member of the United States House of Representatives, from the 1st Congressional District of Oregon between 1946 and 1964.
Family and early life.
Norblad was born in Malmo, Sweden in 1881 to parents Peter and Bessie Youngsberg. The family's last name was changed by the Swedish Government to avoid confusion in military records. The family emigrated to the United States while Albin was very young, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
At age 12, Albin decided to support himself, mostly by means of odd jobs. He would later recount that the most notable jobs held during this time were newsboy, hot dog vendor, and clairinetist for the circuis.
He managed to earn enough money to return to Grand Rapids, taking night classes at the Grand Rapids Business College. After earning enough credits there, Norblad was able enroll at the Chicago Law School, supporting himself as a reporter for the "Chicago American" newspaper's crime beat. Graduating in 1902, he quickly passed the bar exam and moved back to Michigan.
Early political career.
Once in Michigan, he set up a law firm, and was elected District Attorney for Delta County.
While visiting Oregon on business in 1908, Norblad met with an old friend who invited him to live in Astoria. He accepted, and moved with his wife in 1909. He began practicing law, and became involved in the community. His first government office in Oregon was as Astoria's city attorney from 1910 to 1915. He would also become a member of the local school board, and President of the Astoria Chamber of Commerce. Outside of politics, Norblad was involved in many fraternal and civic organizations.
With a prominent local political profile, Norblad went on to run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate, in 1918. Reelected in 1926, he attempted an abortive run for Oregon's At-large U.S. House seat in 1922. He was elected President of the Oregon State Senate in 1927, placing him as second in the state's then-official line of gubernatorial succession.
Governorship.
The death of sitting Governor Isaac Patterson on December 21, 1929 came as a shock to Oregonians. The governor had looked as he'd been recovering since contracting pneumonia late in his third term. Thus Senate President Albin Norblad was sworn promptly as governor. As soon as he was inaugurated, he declared his intent to run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.
Taking office during the Great Depression, Norblad's first attempts to improve conditions in the state were largely ineffective. Lacking a political identity statewide, and considered a Progressive by conserrvative elements in control of the state Republican party, Norblad was defeated in his primary bid in May 1930, coming in second-place. When the winner of the primary unexpectantly died a month later, Norblad took his name out of the running for the nomination, giving the Republican state central committee his blessing to choose a new candidate.
Freed from having to contest an election, Norblad began focusing his attention on the economic situation in the state. He formed the state's first labor commission, later to become the modern Employment Department. In order to put men back to work, he authorized $2 million worth of road construction, and succeeded in employing 5,000 workers. The Oregon Coast Highway was begun under his leadership. Another $3 million was spent upgrading publicly-owned facilities around the state.
The Governor also took a personal role in pardons and labor disputes. A Pardons Board was established, and Norblad even interviewed pardin-seeking inmates in-person.
In matters involving the rest of the nation, Norblad accepted federal help in solving a long-simmering dispute between Eastern Oregon's cattle and sheep ranchers. The Governor indicated his support for the pending military draft legislation working its way through Congress. He also argued for the state's acquisition of federally-owned forest land.
Defeated in his primary bid, Governor Norblad handed office to the victor of the 1931 gubernatorial election, independent candidate Julius L. Meier.
Later life.
Norblad went back to practicing law in Astoria, once again becoming closely involved in the community. He founded the Lower Columbia Association of Chambers of Commerce, and gained a $10,000 grant from the descendants of John Jacob Astor for use in the Astoria Centennial Celebration.
Norblad continued his practice and civic activities in Astioria until his death on April 17, 1960.

= = = Julius L. Meier = = =
Julius L. Meier (December 31, 1874 - July 14, 1937) was a businessman in Portland, Oregon, and governor of Oregon. He was born in Portland to German immigrants of Jewish ancestory: Aaron, a merchant and founder of Oregon's largest department store, Meier &amp; Frank, and Jeannette (Hirsch) Meier. He had three siblings, and was the father of Jean Ellen, Elsa Francis, and Julius L., (Jack) Jr.
He married Grace Mayer on Christmas Day, 1901, saying afterwards that it was the only day that he was allowed off from the store.
Meier graduated from the University of Oregon Law School in 1895 and practiced law with a partner, George W. Joseph for the next four years, until he went into the family's business. According to family tradition, it was at this time that he added the "L" to his name; the sign painter, who was putting his name on the door, insisted that all lawyers of substance had one and Meier suggested an "L".
Meier ran for governor as an independent candidate in 1930, winning 54.5 percent of the total vote, outdistancing his nearest competitor, Democratic candidate Edward F. Bailey, 135,608 votes to 62,434. After serving as governor, he retired to his estate above the Columbia River, "Menucha", where he later died.
His family sold Menucha to First Presbyterian Church of Portland in 1950, which now operates it as a conference and retreat center. The Meier and Frank families sold the department store to the May Company in 1966. With May's sale to Federated in 2005, the store was renamed "Macy's" in September, 2006.

= = = Julian Nagelsmann = = =
Julian Nagelsmann (born 23 July 1987) is a German professional football manager and former player who was formerly head coach of Bayern Munich.
Known for his flexibility with formations, maintaining possession, and developing "gegenpress", Nagelsmann is widely known as one of the best young managers in world football.
Early life.
Nagelsmann was born on 23 July 1987 in Landsberg am Lech, Bavaria. He played for FC Augsburg and 1860 Munich at youth level, and was the captain of Munich's U17 team. In the 2006–07 season, he was part of the second team but could not play a single match due to injuries. Nagelsmann returned to Augsburg for the 2007–08 season coached by Thomas Tuchel, but injured his knee and meniscus for the second time, damaging the cartilage. As a result, he decided to end his footballing career at the age of 20. He had already assisted his head coach Thomas Tuchel as a scout in the first half of 2008. He studied business administration in university for four semesters until he transferred to sports science. Then he focused on coaching, returning to his previous club 1860 Munich as an assistant to Alexander Schmidt for Munich's U17 team from 2008 to 2010.
Coaching career.
Early career.
Nagelsmann joined the 1899 Hoffenheim youth academy in 2010 and coached numerous youth teams in the following years. He was an assistant coach during Hoffenheim's 2012–13 season, and up until 11 February 2016, was coaching the club's U19 team. He coached Hoffenheim's U19 "junior team" to win the 2013–14 Under 19 Bundesliga title. During his time as assistant coach, goalkeeper Tim Wiese referred to Nagelsmann as "Mini-Mourinho."
1899 Hoffenheim.
Nagelsmann was appointed head coach of 1899 Hoffenheim on 27 October 2015. He was expected to begin his tenure at the start of the 2016–17 season. He was given a three-year contract. At the time of his appointment, Nagelsmann was 28, and the youngest coach in Bundesliga history. He was to be the successor for Huub Stevens, who had replaced Markus Gisdol the previous day. On 10 February 2016, Stevens resigned as head coach due to health problems, and Nagelsmann's term as head coach was introduced by the Hoffenheim board a day later.
When Nagelsmann took over the club in February 2016, Hoffenheim were 17th in the table, 7 points from the safety of 15th spot and facing relegation. Under Nagelsmann they avoided relegation by winning 7 of their remaining 14 matches and finished a point above the relegation playoff spot. Their good form continued into the 2016–17 Bundesliga season, where they finished 4th in the table and qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history.
On 9 June 2017, Hoffenheim extended the contract of Nagelsmann until 2021. On 21 June 2018, Hoffenheim announced that Nagelsmann would be leaving the club at the end of the 2018–19 season. He oversaw his 100th league game as manager of Hoffenheim on 19 January 2019, in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich. In doing so, he became the youngest ever Bundesliga manager to reach the 100–match mark.
RB Leipzig.
On 21 June 2019, RB Leipzig announced that Nagelsmann would be their coach from the 2019–20 season and signed a four-year contract which would expire in 2023. Nagelsmann won his first Bundesliga match as RB Leipzig coach against FC Union Berlin 4–0, he also led Leipzig to a 1–1 draw against FC Bayern Munich. On match-day 10 Leipzig won against Mainz 8–0. Nagelsmann faced his former club Hoffenheim on match-day 14 and won 3–1 against them.
On 10 March 2020, following Leipzig's 4–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, Nagelsmann became the youngest coach in history to win a UEFA Champions League knockout tie.
On 13 August 2020, RB Leipzig defeated Spanish side Atlético Madrid 2–1 in the quarter-finals, meaning Leipzig would progress to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in their history. Nagelsmann became the youngest coach in history, therefore, to coach a side in the semi-finals.
On 18 August 2020, RB Leipzig played against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League semi-finals, where Nagelsmann faced his former boss during his time at Augsburg, Thomas Tuchel. However, RB Leipzig lost 3–0 to Paris Saint-Germain.
In the 2020–21 season, RB Leipzig finished second in the Bundesliga and lost the DFB-Pokal Final 4–1 against Borussia Dortmund.
Bayern Munich.
On 27 April 2021, Bayern Munich appointed Nagelsmann as head coach on a five-year contract, effective from 1 July 2021, replacing Hansi Flick for a world record manager transfer fee of 25 million Euros. Nagelsmann's first match as Bayern coach was a 1–1 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga.
In Nagelsmann's first win as Bayern coach he won his first title as a coach in Bayern's 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the 2021 DFL-Supercup.
On 24 August 2021, Nagelsmann led Bayern to a 12–0 victory against Bremer SV during the first round of the 2021–22 DFB-Pokal. The scoreline was their biggest win in 24 years, since their 16–1 victory against DJK Waldberg in the DFB Cup in August 1997.

= = = 2017–2018 United States flu season = = =
The 2017-2018 flu season was a flu season of high severity in the United States. Influenza-like illness (ILI) has a high rate of outpatient and emergency clinic visits, and a high rate of influenza-related hospitalizations, and influenza activities have been on the rise for a long period of time and are widely distributed geographically. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began using a new method to classify seasonal severity and applied the method to the seasons from 2003-2004 to 2016-2017. The 2017-18 season was the first season to be classified as highly serious among all age groups. 
Origin.
In the 2017-2018 season, influenza-like illness (ILI) activities began to increase in November, and reached a long period of high activity nationwide in January and February, and continued until the end of March. The peak of ILI was 7.5%, the highest percentage since the 2009 influenza pandemic (7.7%). Influenza-like illness (ILI) reached or exceeded the national benchmark for 19 weeks, making 2017-2018 one of the longest seasons in recent years.
Infections and Deaths.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are no reports of childhood flu deaths nationwide. To monitor influenza-related deaths of all ages, the CDC tracks deaths caused by pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality reporting system. The system tracks the proportion of death certificates that list pneumonia or influenza as a potential cause of death. The system provides an overall indication of whether influenza-related mortality has increased, but does not provide an exact number to indicate the number of deaths from influenza. During the 2017-2018 season, the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) reached or exceeded the epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks.

= = = Constitution of Singapore = = =
The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is the supreme law of Singapore. It is the only constitution Singapore has had as a sovereign country, and came into effect in 1965. It is largely based on the 1963 Constitution of the "state" of Singapore, which was when Singapore was part of the country of Malaysia, but also of the constitution of that country. 
The constitution sets out the framework for the republic of Singapore, including a President, who is elected every six years, and a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister leads the government and is appointed by the President, but is responsible to the Parliament and must be accepted by it. Singapore's constitution is also based on the Westminster system, which means all ministers must be members of Parliament (MPs). If they, including the Prime Minister, are not elected to Parliament, they cannot remain in their position. The judiciary also has a strong role in the constitution, with judges acting independently of the President, the government and the Parliament. Judges are appointed for a long time, and cannot be removed except for misconduct. The highest court is the Supreme Court of Singapore, which was set up in 1970, five years after the constitution. 
Changing the constitution demands a two-thirds majority vote in the Parliament. However, to change the scope and sovereignty of the country, such as becoming a part of Malaysia again, a referendum showing the support of two-thirds of all voters is required. The constitution is changed from time to time, including to create MPs who are not elected in constituencies, i.e. by the voters, but to introduce representation for others who do not get the support of voters. These are called NMPs and NCMPs. In changing the constitution and some other matters, they are not allowed to vote.

= = = Lonely Planet = = =
Lonely Planet is a huge travel guide book creator. , the company had sold 120 million books since creation.
History.
Early years.
Lonely Planet was created by married couple Maureen and Tony Wheeler. In 1972, they went on a trip through Europe and Asia to Australia.
The company name originates from the misheard "lovely planet" in a song written by Matthew Moore.
Tony returned to Asia to write "Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip", created in 1975.
Expansion.
The Lonely Planet guide book series first expanded in Asia, with the India guide book in 1981, and expanded to rest of the world. Geoff Crowther was noticed for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote. His writing was helpful to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the word "Geoffness", in tribute to Crowther, to show a quality that has been lost in travel guides.
By 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides. The company's creators consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which limousines would arrive, filled with Lonely Planet workers.
Wheelers' sale to BBC.
In 2007, the Wheelers and John Singleton sold a 75% stake in the company to BBC Worldwide, worth a guess of £63 million at the time. The company was creating 500 titles and went into television production. BBC Worldwide struggled following the loss, registering a £3.2 million loss in the year to the end of March 2009. By the end of March 2010, profits of £1.9 million had been generated, as digital profits had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, a "Lonely Planet" magazine had grown and non-print profits grew from 9% in 2007 to 22%. 
Lonely Planet's digital presence included 140 apps and 8.5 million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which made the Thorn Tree travel website forum. BBC Worldwide gained the remaining 25% of the company for £42.1 million (A$67.2 million) from the Wheelers.
BBC's sale to NC2.
By 2012 BBC wanted to sell itself of the company and in March 2013 confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Brad Kelley's NC2 Media for US$77.8 million (£51.5 million), at nearly an £80 million (US$118.89 million) loss. 
COVID-19.
In April 2020 Lonely Planet made the decision to close its Australian and London offices and lower staffing levels globally in response to the loss in the travel industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company continued to create its guidebooks, phrasebooks, maps, children's books and inspirational picture tutorials but chose to close its magazine.
Red Ventures.
In December 2020, NC2 Media sold Lonely Planet to Red Ventures for an unknown amount. Lonely Planet offices continue to work in Dublin, New Delhi and Beijing.
Products.
Lonely Planet's online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996.

Finally, many sources from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam confirmed that there was no such thing as a "bloody massacre" in Huế.
Background.
In the early morning of January 31, 1968, during the Lunar New Year, the People's Army of Vietnam and the Liberation Army of South Vietnam simultaneously launched a surprise attack in many cities and localities in South Vietnam - in the early morning of January 31, 1968. including Saigon and Huế. After initial military successes, they were overwhelmed by the enemy and pushed back everywhere, except Huế. Although the Tet Offensive was considered a tactical defeat, it was a victory of great strategic importance.
With the aim of seizing sovereignty over Huế, a 28-day battle between the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the US Army and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam took place and resulted in 40% of the city being destroyed, 116,000 homeless people. The US Army and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam suffered about 4,400 casualties, while the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the Vietnam People's Army also lost over 4,000 troops. Also in this re-occupation, the US army used maximum heavy weapons such as napalm bombs, cannons, tank cannons and large recoilless guns . Out of 17,134 houses in Huế, 9,776 houses were completely destroyed, 3,169 were severely damaged; The number of civilians killed according to the first estimate of the government of the Republic of Vietnam was 3,776. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army documents said they buried about 2,000 bomb victims in mass graves along with their own dead soldiers.
Aftermath.
In the months and years that followed the Battle of Mau Than at Hue, which began on January 31, 1968, and lasted a total of 26 days, dozens of mass graves were discovered in and around Huế. Victims include women, men, children and baby.
According to Gareth Porter, an American scholar, early estimates by the Ministry of Immigration and Social Security of the Republic of Vietnam put the number of civilians killed by fighting and artillery fire at 3,776, out of the total number of civilians. wounded, dead or missing were 6,700 people. Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci in her autographs said that about 1,100 people were killed when the North Vietnamese troops recaptured Huế, most of the people killed were teachers, lectures, university students, monks, intellectuals and religion followers (mostly buddhist). Historian Stanley Karnow believes that many civilians were executed by the North Vietnamese and their bodies were buried in mass graves.
According to Lê Minh, the commander of the campaign for the whole Thừa Thiên Huế area, the Secretary of the Hue City Party Committee during the Tết Offensive, wrote in his memoirs published in 1988, most civilians died due to being hit by American bombs. city, only a small number were killed as civilians rebelled against those they hated.
A Vietnamese witness in Huế, Nguyễn Thị Hoa, said: ""It started with them (US troops) using artillery." "They bombarded the area where we lived, razed houses and trees." "They fired artillery at the houses in the surrounding areas." "These houses sold gasoline, so when the firecrackers were fired, they burned down." "All the elderly, children, and women who took refuge here were burned alive.""
Don Oberdorfer also cited several sources reporting that there were "revenge teams" set up by the Republic of Vietnam, which hunted down and executed civilians who had supported the Liberation Army while they were stationed in Huế.

= = = Peranakan = = =
Peranakan refers to mixed Chinese and Malay/Indonesian people. Many Peranakans trace their origins to 15th-century Malacca.
The first Baba-Nyonya originated, from the 15th century, from marriages between Chinese merchants and Malay or Indonesian women.
The Baba-Nyonya partly adopted Malay customs in order to integrate into local communities. During British rule, they acquired a strong influence in the Straits colonies and were even nicknamed the King's Chinese.
Today, their particular identity tends to fade slowly, the younger generation adopting a more standardised Chinese culture.
In Java, Indonesia, the term Peranakan designates the mixed Chinese communities of locals from the cities of Pasisir (north coast of the island). In the Indonesian context, their outward characteristics fadesd all the more as the Indonesians categorized as Chinese properly speaking were forced, during the Soeharto regime (1966-98), to hide outward traces of their identity.
At various times and for various reasons, the Peranakan migrated extensively within the Nusantara region, between Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. This has resulted in a greater homogeneity of this population. The Peranakan culture is losing its positions and its popularity. Due to the political motives of the countries, the Peranakans of Malaysia and Singapore are increasingly approaching the culture of the Chinese on the mainland. At the same time, the Peranakans of Indonesia, due to the long ban on the Chinese language and the persecution of the Chinese during the reign of Suharto, are increasingly losing their native culture.
Baba and Peranakan Chinese speak a Malay creole, "Baba Malay", a mixture of English, Malay and Hokkien (a Chinese dialect).
Migrations to neighboring countries led to the emergence of small Peranakan communities in Vietnam and Australia .

= = = Playing for Time (movie) = = =
Playing for Time is a made-for-television movie about the Holocaust. Arthur Miller wrote the movie. He based it on Fania Fénelon's true book about her life, called "The Musicians of Auschwitz". The movie was on television on CBS in 1980.
Story.
At the Auschwitz death camp, the Nazis choose women who can sing and play instruments to make music for them. They become the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. The women see the things that happen in the camp and try to stay alive long enough for the war to end.
Name.
The title comes from the English expression "playing for time" which means to stall or delay something bad from happening and the word "playing" as in playing an instrument. The women in "Playing for Time" are playing music so that the Nazis won't kill them yet.
Critical reception.
Critics said the movie was "the best script [Miller] has written in years." The movie won many Emmys, a Golden Globe and the Peabody Award.
People did not like that directors chose Vanessa Redgrave to be Fania Fénelon. Redgrave did not like Israel and was pro-Palestine. Fénelon herself said that Redgrave was too tall and did not have a good sense of humor, which she said was one way she stayed alive in the camp. She wanted Liza Manelli instead of Redgrave.
Other members of the women's orchestra said that not all of Fénelon's story was true: They said that Alma Rosé had not been as bad as Fénelon said. They said Fénelon's story made it look like she had saved their lives when really Rosé had saved their lives. Some of the women also said they did not like that very private moments in their lives were in a movie for everyone to see.
Adaptation.
Arthur Miller also wrote a play "Playing for Time", but it was after the movie, not before.

The 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses were the first votes to decide the nominee in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries for the 2020 United States presidential election, taking place on 3 February 2020. The winner was Pete Buttigieg, which made him the first openly gay person to win a presidential contest. The Iowa caucuses are closed caucuses, only allowing for people who are registered in the Democratic Party to vote. Iowa gives 49 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of which 41 are pledged delegates given to candidates based on the results of the caucuses.
After a three day delay in reporting the votes, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that Buttigieg had been awarded two more delegates than Sanders, but Sanders had won the popular vote in the state. Most of the media outlets would say that Buttigieg would be the winner, but the Associated Press declined to declare who would be the winner until all recount voting processes had been finished. The official result and calculation of pledged delegates was delayed again by a further six days after the election as they needed to correct the results from 3.1% (55) of the precincts. Both Buttigieg and Sanders then requested a recanvass for 8.1% of the official results, which narrowed Buttigieg's lead over Sanders to 0.08 state delegate equivalents.
The caucuses would be controversial because of the delays in the reporting of the results. Much of the delay was as a result of the mobile application used to report voting totals. More controversy started because of the errors and continued changing in the calculation and reporting of the state delegate equivalents. The Iowa Democratic Party chair would resign on the 12 February 2020 because of the criticism of the reporting.

"EastEnders".
On 19 March 2014, it was announced that the popular BBC long-running continuous drama "EastEnders," had cast Hammond in the role of disabled market trader Donna Yates. The character of Donna was not originally going to be written into "EastEnders" as a disabled character, but Hammond impressed bosses at her audition, and was awarded the part. Donna is the second disabled regular in the soap, after Adam Best (David Proud) who left the show in 2010. Speaking of her casting, Hammond said: "I'm really excited to join the cast of "EastEnders". It's a great opportunity to be a part of such a big and popular show. Donna is a bit of a handful but they're always the most fun characters to play! It feels good to be bad!" Donna's storylines have included: her fierce attitude, which often runs her into arguments; the introduction of her family; and a relationship with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). Lisa decided to leave the soap in 2018 to pursue other roles. Her last appearance in "EastEnders" was on 20 July 2018, when Donna was seen leaving in the back of a black cab.

Hammond grew up with a restricted growth condition. She revealed in October 2015 that she has received abuse from strangers in the street because of her disability. She spoke about how her wheelchair use received backlash from the public. "The main image of wheelchair users is that of paralysis. So when I get out of my chair to do a scene on my feet, people don't like it. If I'm feeling good and want to walk in that scene, I will. But if I can't or pain levels are bad then I'll use my chair. I've been shouted at. I've had people say, 'Oi, why are you in a chair when you were walking on "EastEnders" last night?'" Hammond also revealed how she had received criticism like this before joining "EastEnders" and that she can struggle with this backlash. "People always think I'm this feisty girl and I can hold my own but in those moments you just don't think of anything to say. It's shock and disbelief. I have to laugh it off."
On 7 September 2017, she participated in the documentary series "Who Do You Think You Are?" and discovered that her maternal side originally came from Wales.

"Blind Ambition" is the 3rd episode of "Family Guy"s 4th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 15, 2005. The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and Chuck Klein is the director of the episode. The episode is about Peter Griffin going blind after trying to get a world record.
Story.
Mort Goldman gets popular for getting the highest possible score in bowling. Lois goes to the bowling alley and is shocked to see Glenn Quagmire watching her in a bathroom. Quagmire gets arrested but is freed by his neighbor Joe Swanson. Lois and other wives in her neighborhood want Quagmire taken away from the neighborhood. They later say they will let him stay if he stops harassing women. They help Quagmire control himself using operant conditioning (learning about the consequences of one's behaviors). They take Quagmire to a shopping mall. Quagmire sees cheerleaders in a fountain and starts to feel worried. He finds a room with video cameras of women in changing rooms. He sees a woman having a heart attack in one of the cameras. He runs to the woman and does CPR. Quagmire gets awarded for saving the woman from dying. 
Peter feels sad because his friends have had success, but he says he has not. He thinks he will be famous if he gets a world record for eating the most nickels. He tries to eat many nickels, but gets poisoned and goes blind. Peter gets a guide dog and goes to a bar. He ties the dog's leash to a homeless person thinking it is a parking meter. He goes to the bar and does not know it is burning. He saves the bartender from the fire and is called a hero by a news anchor. Peter gets new eyes from the homeless person he tied his guard dog to.
Production.
"Family Guy" was first cancelled after its 3rd season. 5 scripts were made in 2001 for if "Family Guy" was brought back by the Fox network. "Blind Ambition" was made from one of the scripts. This is the second episode where Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken get in a fight. This was supposed to be shown in the episode "The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire". That episode was too long to show them fighting, so it was put in "Blind Ambition". Some parts of this episode were made but not broadcast. One of these was during Quagmire trying to control himself, where Brian Griffin uses a forklift to carry pornographic magazines away from Quagmire's house.
Many people called David Goodman to say they did not like blind Peter seducing his son Chris thinking he is Lois. Chris Sheridan said that people were also not happy with Quagmire watching Lois in the bathroom. The Fox network can not use the words "Jesus Christ" if they are not talking about Jesus himself. One part of the episode shows God saying "Jesus Christ!" when he accidentally kills a person. Jesus was put in the episode with God so that the part of the episode can be broadcast.
Reception.
The episode was seen by about 9.26 million people when it was first broadcast.
Kevin Wong from "PopMatters" said that the episode was better than the 4th season's first two episodes. Mike Drucker from IGN thought that Peter and Ernie's fight was funny in the first episode they were in, but said it was not interesting this time. However, Drucker liked the reference to "Star Wars" at the end of the episode.

However, having non-rancid nuts, which are high in omega-6, is associated with lower risk for some diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, stroke, heart attacks and certain cancers.
Modern Western diets often have ratios of omega-6 to omega 3 higher than 10. Some are as high as 30. The normal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the Western diet is 15–16.7, mainly from vegetable oils.
Dietary sources.
Vegetable oils are a major source of omega-6 linoleic acid. Worldwide, more than 100 million metric tons of vegetable oils are extracted annually from palm fruits, soybean seeds, rape seeds, and sunflower seeds, providing more than 32 million metric tons of omega-6 linoleic acid and 4 million metric tons of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid.

= = = Perkele = = =
Perkele () is a swear word in Finnish that means "evil spirit" or a version of "god damn". It is popular, and is most likely the most known Finnish curse word in the world.
Origins.
The name is Indo-European. Perkwunos is the reconstructed name of the god of thunder. Other gods said to have the same origin include Perkūnas (Lithuania), Pērkons (Latvia), Percunis (Prussia), Piarun (Belarus), Peko or Pekolasõ (Estonia), Parjanya (India), Fairguneis (Gothic), and Perun or Piorun (Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia).
Some researchers think "Perkele" is an original name of the thunder god Ukko, the chief god of the Finnish pagan pantheon. There are related words in other Finnic languages. In Estonian, "põrgu" means hell and in Karelian, "perkeleh" means an evil spirit.
Use.
It has been used as a curse as a cry for the god for strength. It still is a common curse word in colloquial Finnish. Finnish people use the word to be more serious and powerful than less powerful curses. When the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland held a contest to nominate the "most energizing" word in the Finnish language, one of the suggestions was Perkele because "it is the curse word that gave the most strength for the reconstruction of Finland after the wars."
Introduction of Christianity.
As Finland was Christianized, the old Finnish deities were said to be demons, so "Devil" was translated to "Perkele" for the Finnish translation of the Bible. Some later translations use "paholainen" (the evil one) instead.

= = = Sea of Japan naming dispute = = =
There is a body of water between the Japanese islands, Russia, North and South Korea. The countries affected have not been able to agree on a common name for this body of water. So far, most countries called it "Sea of Japan". North and South Korea do not want this name, they suggested to call it "East Sea", or "East Sea of Korea". In 1992, both Koreas raised concerns about the name, at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. The Japanese government says that only the name "Sea of Japan" (���) should be used. South Korea supports the alternative name "East Sea" (Korean: ��; Hanja: ��). North Korea supports the name "East Sea of Korea" (Korean: ����; Hanja: ����). Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or a translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea. Very often, the name East Sea is listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as an alternative. The International Hydrographic Organization is responsible for naming bodies of water around the world. In 2012, it decided it was still unable to change the 1953 version of its publication S-23 – Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single name "Sea of Japan", to include "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan".
The countries have given different arguments, for their naming proposition, but each name has its problems:
The International Hydrographic organisation made a resolution in 1974. In this resolution, it stated that in the case that the countries cannot agree on a common name for a body of water, all names should be accepted. However, Japan argues that the resolution only applies to the bays and straits which are shared by multiple countries, and in case of high seas such as the Sea of Japan, it is not applicable. Japan also cites the United Nations’ policy for using the Sea of Japan as an official name for their reasoning.

= = = Nikkatsu = = =
The Nikkatsu Corporation (������, "Nikkatsu Kabushiki-gaisha") is a Japanese entertainment company known for its film and television productions. It is Japan's oldest major movie studio, founded in 1912 during the silent film era. The name Nikkatsu amalgamates the words Nippon Katsudō Shashin, literally "Japan Motion Pictures".
Overview.
Nikkatsu's history dates back as early as 1912 when 4 companies merged to form Nippon Katsudo Shashin Corporation, the first film conglomerate in the region to produce, distribute and exhibit theatrical films. In 1952 Chofu Studio was built in Tokyo as the largest modern film studio in the Asia Pacific Region at the time; the studio even had a permanent set of Ginza city. It quickly became the cornerstone of the company's Golden Era, together with its string of attractive stars who were then all exclusive to Nikkatsu; the legendary superstar Yujiro Ishihara, handsome young actors under the "Nikkatsu New Face" banner including Akira Kobayashi and Joe Shishido; actresses such as Sayuri Yoshinaga and Ruriko Asaoka; and directors Seijun Suzuki and Shohei Imamura. Nikkatsu was the leading studio in Japan, enjoying box office mega-hits with its action films starring Ishihara ("Crazed Fruit"), teenage love stories starring Yoshinaga ("Cupola, Where the Furnaces Grow"), and "Branded to Kill" starring Joe Shishido, works with a continuing international appeal to this day - the films were so successful that Ishihara and Yoshinaga are still regarded as icons of the Showa period.
When cinema attendance began to drop, Japanese studios slashed their annual film production. Nikkatsu, however, took a unique turn in 1971 when it launched the "Nikkatsu Roman Porn" brand, namely films for the adult audience. As one director recalls, "I had total creative freedom, as long as I kept some nudity in the film", the brand enabled Nikkatsu to be the only major studio in Japan at the time to continue producing films and hire young film makers. Thus, Nikkatsu soon became the hub for upcoming innovative talents, and many of the directors who were given this rare opportunity, later became dominant film makers in Japan; amongst them are Oscar winner Youjiro Takita ("Departure"), multi-time Japanese Academy winners Masayuki Suo ("Shall We Dance?"), Yoshimitsu Morita, Youichi Sai, Shinji Soumai, and many more. The brand continued until 1988.
In 2005, Naoki Sato was appointed President of the company. Originally a producer himself, Nikkatsu's recent array of titles under his leadership includes cutting-edge genre films by Sion Sono and Takashi Miike, and dramatical masterpieces. They have been highly acclaimed, including numerous Japanese Academy winners and nominees such as "Rebirth", "Cold Fish" and "The Devil's Path".
Today.
Today, Nikkatsu's business activities include operation of the production studio, overseas film acquisition, distribution, a cable TV channel (Channel NECO) and a Film Course at Josai International University. It is also a member of the Yomiuri-Nippon TV group, the leading media conglomerate in Japan.
In today's fast evolving market, Nikkatsu has a focus on international activities - in 2014, the company established Kantana Japan, a JV with a Thai production group - and seeks to work more closely with partners outside the industry and around the globe.

= = = Planned obsolescence = = =
Planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is an idea in economics and product design. Planned obsolescence is when someone makes a product so that it will wear out after only a short time. It will either stop working, work much worse than before, or be unfashionable. This way, the person who bought the product must buy a new one sooner than if the old product had lasted a long time. This is often called ""shortening the replacement cycle.""
Planned obsolescence works when company selling the product has few or no other companies making the same product, because the consumer has few choices. Before choosing this strategy, the producer has to make sure that the consumer will likely buy from them again and not from someone else. Usually, there is information asymmetry: the producer knows how long the product was designed to last, and the consumer does not. However, when many companies make the same product, they compete. Then product lifespans often increase. In the 1960s and 1970s, the first Japanese cars were sold in America. Because they had longer lifespans than the American car models, American car manufacturers were forced to build cars that lasted longer.
History.
In 1924, the American market for cars became saturated. That meant that almost everyone who could buy a car had already bought one. In order to still sell about the same number of cars, Alfred P. Sloan Jr. who worked at General Motors suggested that new cars should look different every year. This way, at least some car owners would buy a new car every year. This idea was not new. It had already been tried with bicycles, but people say it was Sloan's idea. Sloan often used the words "dynamic obsolescence", but people who did not like the idea called it "planned obsolescence".
This plan changed many things in the automobile industry, product design field and eventually the whole American economy. Smaller companies could not afford to re-style their car models every year. Henry Ford did not like the idea either. Ford was an engineer, and he liked simplicity, economies of scale, and strong design. In 1931, GM sold more cars than Ford and became the strongest company making cars. Changing the design every year meant GM had to use a body-on-frame structure rather than the lighter unibody design used by most European automakers because unibody is harder to change.
The words "planned obsolescence" were first seen in print in 1932 in Bernard London's pamphlet "Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence". London said the government should tell manufacturers of personal-use items to use planned obsolescence so people would always buy them. However, the phrase became famous in 1954 because of Brooks Stevens, an American industrial designer. Stevens was due to give a talk at an advertising conference in Minneapolis in 1954. Without giving it much thought, he used the term as the title of his talk. From that point on, "planned obsolescence" became Stevens' catchphrase. Stevens said planned obsolescence was "Instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary."
Other people quickly began to use the phrase. By the late 1950s, "planned obsolescence" had become a common term for products designed to break easily or to quickly go out of style. The idea of planned obsolescence was so widely known that, in 1959, Volkswagen made jokes about it in an advertising campaign. Volkswagen tried to make it look as though it did not use planned obsolescence: "We do not believe in planned obsolescence," the ads said. "We don't change a car for the sake of change." In the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign by Doyle Dane Bernbach, one advert showed an almost blank page with the line "No point in showing the 1962 Volkswagen, it still looks the same."
In 1960, cultural critic Vance Packard wrote "The Waste Makers", which was meant to be an exposé of "the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals." Packard divided planned obsolescence into two sub categories: obsolescence of desirability and obsolescence of function.
"Obsolescence of desirability," a.k.a. "psychological obsolescence," referred to marketers' attempts to wear out a product in the owner's mind. Packard quoted industrial designer George Nelson, who wrote:"Design... is an attempt to make a contribution through change. When no contribution is made or can be made, the only process available for giving the illusion of change is 'styling!'"

= = = 2021 UEFA Champions League Final = = =
The 2021 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, the 66th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 29th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal on 29 May 2021, between English clubs Manchester City, in their first European Cup final, and 2012 winners Chelsea. This was the third all-English final in the competition, after the 2008 and 2019 finals. 
The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final to Lisbon as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the final hosts were moved back a year, with the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey instead planning to host the 2021 final. Two weeks before the final, UEFA announced that it would be relocated to Porto to allow a limited number of fans to attend the match. A capacity limit of 33% was agreed for the 50,000-seater Estádio do Dragão, resulting in an attendance of 14,110.
Chelsea won the final 1–0 for their second UEFA Champions League title, with Kai Havertz scoring the only goal of the game late in the first half. As winners, they earned the right to play against the winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League, Villarreal, in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, both of which they won.
Teams.
"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era."
Venue.
The match was the fourth European Cup/Champions League final to take place in Portugal, and the first to take place outside Lisbon, which previously hosted finals in 1967 at the Estádio Nacional and in 2014 and 2020 at the Estádio da Luz. This was the first time the European Cup/Champions League final took place in the same country in successive seasons. The Estádio do Dragão previously hosted matches at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals. Additionally, this final was the first since 2004 to be held in a stadium with capacity lower than 60,000.
Initial host selection.
An open bidding process was launched on 22 September 2017 by UEFA to select the venues of the finals of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Women's Champions League in 2020. Associations had until 31 October 2017 to express interest, and bid information must be submitted by 1 March 2018. Associations hosting matches at UEFA Euro 2020 were not allowed to bid for the 2020 UEFA Champions League final.
UEFA announced on 3 November 2017 that two associations had expressed interest in hosting the 2020 UEFA Champions League final.
The Atatürk Olympic Stadium was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Kyiv on 24 May 2018.
On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final to the Estádio da Luz, Istanbul would instead host the 2021 final.
Relocation to Porto.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, Premier League side Aston Villa offered to have Villa Park in Birmingham as the venue for the Champions League Final instead of Istanbul to hold 8,000 English fans, which could be affected by travel limitations. Villa Park has previously hosted the 1999 Cup Winners' Cup Final, the last final of that UEFA competition. It also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, also contested between Manchester City and Chelsea, due to Wembley Stadium – England's national stadium – hosting the Olympic football tournament finals in the previous days, being picked in part because of its equal distances between Manchester and London. On 7 May 2021, Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps advised against any fans traveling to Turkey for the game.
In negotiations with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, UEFA would only consider Wembley as a potential venue within the United Kingdom, and required guarantees that their officials, sponsors and journalists would be exempt from the UK COVID-19 travel restrictions. The British Government was unable to agree to this, and on 13 May 2021, UEFA announced the final was relocated to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal, a country that was on the British "green list" for unrestricted travel during the pandemic.
Background.
Manchester City were playing in their first European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. They had previously played in one European final, the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, and won. They became the ninth English side to play in a European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. This was the third UEFA Champions League final for manager Pep Guardiola, and his first since the two wins with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, both against Manchester United. City were seeking to become the first club to win its first European Cup/UEFA Champions League final since Borussia Dortmund in 1997, which seven clubs had failed to do in between.
Chelsea were playing in their third European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and the first since their win in 2012 away against Bayern Munich. In addition, they had previously played in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Europa League finals twice each – winning all. In addition, Chelsea became the first club ever to see its men's and women's teams reach the Champions League final in the same season, having qualified for the 2021 UEFA Women's Champions League Final as well. Head coach Thomas Tuchel became the first manager to reach the European Cup/UEFA Champions League final in successive seasons with different clubs, having lost the 2020 final to Bayern Munich while coaching Paris Saint-Germain.
This was the third all-English final in the history of the competition, after 2008 in Moscow between Chelsea and Manchester United and 2019 in Madrid between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. This was also the third consecutive Champions League final to feature a first-time finalist, after Tottenham in 2019 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2020.
This was the third meeting between the teams in Europe, having previously met in the semi-finals of the 1970–71 European Cup Winners' Cup, where Chelsea won both legs 1–0 en route to their first European trophy. It was also the second major cup final between them, after the 2019 EFL Cup Final, which City won on penalties following a goalless draw after extra time. The teams met twice during the season's Premier League, with each side winning away: City won the first match 3–1 at Stamford Bridge, while Chelsea won the second 2–1 at Etihad Stadium three weeks before the final. Three weeks before the second league encounter, Chelsea also beat City 1–0 in the FA Cup semi-finals, denying City the chance of winning an unrivaled quadruple.

= = = Intifada = = =
Intifada (Arabic: �������) is an Arabic word. In Arabic, intifada means "shaking off". An intifada can be seen as a way for people to "shake off" a power that is oppressing them, a so called "uprising" against that power. The term Intifada is most famous for the two Palestinian uprisings in the 1980s and 2000s. These two intifadas are considered part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There were also other intifadas outside of Palestine, the protests in Bahrain against British presence from 1965 until 1972 are called the 'March Intifada'. 
List of intifadas.
The First Intifada took place from 1987 to 1993, when Palestinians rebelled against the Israeli power.
The Second Intifada began in 2000 and lasted until 2005. This Intifada is sometimes called the Al-Aqsa Intifada and was also where Palestinians rebelled against the Israeli power.
The March Intifada in Bahrain broke out in March 1965 and protests were renewed every year until 1972. This Intifada was about people from Bahrain against the British power.
First Intifada (1987-1993).
The period of the first Intifada started on 9 December 1987 and ended with the in 1993. This Intifada lasted a total of six years.
The Palestinian unrest which led to the outbreak of the first intifada started with the Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, forcing Palestinians to leave their land. Other reasons for the Palestinian rebellion were the worsening economy and the limited access to jobs.
Start of the First Intifada.
The first protests against Israel's occupation erupted in Gaza. A car belonging to the Israeli army drove into a Palestinian car, killing all four occupants on 8 December 1987. That night, protests broke out in a Palestinian refugee camp during the funeral of the victims. It became a Palestinian mass uprising against the occupation, Palestinians came into active resistance.
A party (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising: ) was established which brought together all important Palestinian organizations and parties that already opposed Israel before the Intifada.
Casualties and overview.
The first Intifada is often known for its nonviolent nature. The nonviolent resistance from Palestinians existed of the boycott of Israeli products, strikes and the refusal to pay taxes or other obligated payments to Israel. However, the idea that the intifada was nonviolent is not correct. The more violence Palestinians used the more violent the Israeli responses became.
In 1989 the Israeli security forces switched to extreme violent tactics in this period. The Israeli tactics from this period led to a peak in Palestinian violence as well.
An estimated number of 1282 Palestinians died and more than 130.472 became injured during the six year period of the Intifada. For every three Palestinians that died, less than one Israeli was killed.
End of the First Intifada.
The Intifada officially ended on the 13th of September 1993, when the was signed by the PLO and Israeli government. This declaration was also the start of the Oslo accords, in which Palestine and Israel would start to discuss the many issues on autonomy, borders, refugees and Jerusalem.
Second Intifada (2000-2005).
The period of the Second Intifada is marked from September 2000 until February 2005, even though opinions may differ about when it ended. The Second Intifada was more violent than the first.
Overview.
After the First Intifada ended in 1993, there was still a lot of discontent among the Palestinians. They didn't agree with how the Oslo accords were followed by Israel. When the Israeli premier Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in a provocative way, it was the last straw for the Palestinians. This is why some people also call this uprising the 'Al-Aqsa Intifada'.
The Second Intifada began with Palestinian demonstrations. These started in Jerusalem, but quickly spread to the West Bank. In the beginning the Palestinians mostly threw rocks and were not obedient towards the Israelis, the Israelis were heavily armed.
Later on, the Palestinians used other, more deadly tactics. Some of them were suicide bombings, snipers and rocket attacks.
In 2002, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli government decided to build a barrier between Israel and the West Bank.
Another important event during the Second Intifada was the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. This happened after things escalated between Hamas and the Israeli occupiers, which resulted in many deaths on both sides.
The ending and aftermath.
In 2005, after more than 5 years, the Second Intifada came to an end. In 2004 the intensity of the uprising was already fading. This was because of the Palestinians becoming weary, struggling against the strong lasting Israeli defense.
The Second Intifada was more violent than the first one, causing over 3000 Palestinian and nearly 1000 Israeli deaths.
March Intifada (Bahrain).
In March 1965 an Intifada broke out in Bahrain. The goal of the uprising was to stop the British presence in Bahrain. This Intifada was mostly led by groups with leftists ideas. Multiple people died, because of the violence the police used several times during the demonstrations. The protests started when a huge amount of workers from the Bahrain Petroleum company resigned. It changed fast into a general strike against the British.
The protests continued to happen annually until 1972. In 1972 the government agreed to talk with the opposition and they allowed three members from the workers union to join the government. The Bahrain Intifada took officially from 1965 to 1975.

= = = Economies of scale = = =
In economics, economies of scale means that when more units of a product are made at the same time, the cost it takes to produce a single unit will go down. When making a product, there is a maximum capacity that can be made, at a given time. This capacity depends on the ways in which the product is made. If it is made by machines, these machines have a maximum number they can produce. Wanting to produce more than this number means new machines (or a new way to make these products) are needed. Adam Smith first had this idea of economy of scale, which he obtained through division of labour. 
The opposite of economies of scale are diseconomies of scale.

Numbering.
In the nationwide numbering scheme, routes are divided into a hierarchy of three categories: national routes, which are the most important routes connecting major cities; provincial routes, which connecting smaller cities and towns to the national route network; and regional routes, which connect smaller towns to the route network. Route numbers are allocated to these classes as follows:
These numbers are allocated by the Route Numbering and Road Traffic Signs Sub Committee within the Roads Co-ordinating Body, an organisation which contains representatives from road authorities in national, provincial and local government.
In metropolitan numbering schemes the local authority can designate routes consisting of M followed by any number. The following metropolitan municipalities and their cities have metropolitan numbering schemes.

= = = Reuven Fahn = = =
Reuven Fahn ( 18781939 or 1944) was a Polish Jewish writer who was active in the decades before the Holocaust.
Early life.
Reuven Fahn was born on 21 February 1878 in the village of Starunia in southeastern Austrian Galicia. Fahn could read and write in Hebrew, German, Yiddish, Polish, and Ukrainian by the age of 15. In 1897, at age 19, Fahn married Rachel Keren and moved to his wife's hometown, the Polish city of Halicz. In Halicz, Fahn was influenced by the Karaite Jewish community and their unique culture, which Fahn often wrote about in his literary works.
Mid-life and later life.
After Russia conquered eastern Galicia at the start of World War I in 1914, Fahn and many other Galician Jews fled to Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. Fahn enjoyed the libraries in Vienna and worked as a librarian during his time there. He was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army on 1 December 1914. His military service ended on 2 November 1918, with Austria-Hungary's existence ending soon afterwards. Due to his house and property in Halicz being destroyed due to World War I, Fahn moved to Stanisławów (present-day Ivano-Frankivsk). Afterwards, Fahn continued his work, but as a Polish citizen.
During a 1924 trip to Mandatory Palestine, Fahn created a Galician Zionist colony there. Fahn himself thought about moving to Palestine the next year, but decided not to since he feared that Palestine would soon have an economic crisis. The decision by Fahn and many other Galician Zionists to stay in Poland ended up being deadly for them due to the Holocaust destroying most of Poland's Jewish population by 1945. In 1930, Fahn maintained a correspondence with Hayim Nahman Bialik.
Personal life.
Fahn and his first wife had two daughters. His wife died when he was 25 years old. Fahn's eldest daughter Hana was later murdered in the Holocaust while her two daughters survived. In 1905, Fahn remarried to a woman from the city of Bolechow, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Yafa, Fahn's daughter from his second marriage, died at age nine while Fahn and his family were living in Vienna. Yosef, the sickly son from Fahn's second marriage, eventually had a son of his own but he and his entire family were murdered during the Holocaust.
Fahn's exact year and date of death are not known; 1939, 1940, and 1944 were all proposed for this. One report states that he was arrested and killed by the Soviets for Zionist activities a short time before World War II began. Another, possibly more reliable report states that he was murdered by the Nazis and their local Ukrainian allies in Stanisławów at the age of 66 in 1944.

= = = 2021 Texas power crisis = = =
In February 2021, the state of Texas had a major power crisis, because of three winter storms in the United States on February 10–11, 13–17, and 15–20. The crisis was caused by a massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas; and caused shortages of water, food, and heat. 
Affected places.
More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power, some for several days. At least 151 people were killed. The total damage is estimated to be between $100 billion and $200 billion, making it as expensive as Hurricane Harvey and other major disasters.
Causes.
The Texas crisis's proximate causes were two unanticipated shocks induced from the sub-zero temperatures (‐2 � F in Dallas): a failure of conventional (thermal) generating supply, mostly from lack of natural gas, and a surge in electricity demand. Inadequate winterization caused freezing of the gas supply and many plants' control instruments. In a system with a winter peak of 66 GW, about 30 GW of thermal plants were unavailable. In its worst-case extreme-winter analysis, ERCOT had expected a loss of 14 GW of thermal resources. The February storm caused more than double the anticipated thermal outages.
Simultaneously, electric heaters created a powerful surge in demand. About 61% of Texans rely on electric heat, mostly low-efficiency resistance heat, in poorly insulated homes — a seemingly sensible choice in a warm climate with cheap electricity, where home heating is often unnecessary. The demand surge caused by the cold came to about 20 GW or one-third of the winter peak. ERCOT based its worst-case analysis on a 2011 winter storm, the most severe cold-weather event in Texas in twenty years. The 2021 storm was much worse than that of 2011. It created an unexpected and unsupportable demand surge.
Timeline of events.
During the weekend of February 13-14, the temperature dropped more than what ERCOT estimated and as demand for electricity hit a record, the utility had to implement rolling power outages starting early morning Monday, February 15th. Temperatures in Texas averaged 30 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the normal during.
On Tuesday, 16 GW of renewables went down, including generation from wind, and 30 GW was lost from thermal sources including coal, gas and nuclear. By Wednesday 46 GW of total electricity generation was offline with 28 GW of thermal and 18 GW of renewable.
As the demand soared and regional power generators crashed, the frequency of the system also started to drop from the normal 60 Hz to 59.3 Hz. Had the system frequency’s fallen below 59 Hz, the state’s electrical system would have suffered from cascading blackouts which would have lasted for weeks or months and could have caused physical damage to equipment. This would have been much more difficult to recover so to protect the system, load was deliberately shed by the system operator.

RNA-Seq (short for "RNA sequencing") is a technique to get snapshots of the continuously changing RNA landscape in a cell.

RNAs also have many roles that fall outside this framework. RNA-Seq is typically used to analyze the amount of each gene's RNA in experimental samples. For example, in gene expression and changes made during RNA processing (alternative splicing, editing, mutations, or fusions between RNAs). RNA-Seq requires molecular biology and computational steps. 
Recent advances in RNA-Seq include the ability to study single cells and entire single RNA molecules. It has broad applications in the life sciences from agriculture to medicine.

= = = Curlew = = =
The curlew is Numenius, a bird with a long downcurved bill (beak). With its beak the bird probes mudflats for food. 
In pre-modern times the world had many more mudflats than it does today. Many have been eliminated by draining so as to give more land for farming. So, in England, the places suitable for the bird were in river estuaries and low-lying land. Originally, southern England had wide areas of mudflats suitable for the bird.
What changed was the draining of the "levels" to make for better farming. In England areas in East Anglia, Kent and Somerset were all drained and made productive farmland. A similar process happened in many countries. The consequence is that the curlews' numbers have dropped and the bird has become rare in places where it was once common.
Broadly speaking, curlews are waders, as are the godwits which look similar but have straight bills.
Most curlews migrate and so one or more species occur at different times of the year in Europe, Ireland, Britain, Iberia, Iceland, Africa, Southeast Asia, Siberia, North America, South America and Australasia. There are nine species of curlew.

= = = Stepper motor = = =
A stepper motor is an electric motor that is able to create sharp movements. It is used, for example, in printers. They are also commonly found in robots, automotive devices, and computer hard drives. Like other electric motors, they need an electrical circuit to work. Typically they have more than two wires to control them. There are several versions of stepper motors and several ways to drive them.
DC motors can be considered using two general categories, stepper motors and servo motors.
Servo motors needs a continuous feedback of position to control the state of the motor in order to give the motor specific or desired speed or position. These types of stepper motor are usually more expensive because they required additional circuitry to acquire this constant positional feedback.
The other type of generalized motor is called a stepper motor. This stepper motor is commonly used for simple experiments because it is inexpensive. It doesn't require the position of the motor to be known, hence it won't require additional circuitry. A stepper motor turns to a specific positions in using a constant sequence. This sequence can be achieved in multiple ways.
Full stepping, half stepping, and micro stepping are ways to achieve a sequence of steps from the motor. 
Full stepping with a two phase motor calls for two coils to be alternated simultaneously. This form of stepping will allow the motor to spin, but the angle of that spin will be based upon the step angle. The step angle is equal to the 360 degrees divided by the steps per revolutions. The steps per revolutions are found by the number phases on the stator times the number of permanent magnets available to the motor.

= = = Header file = = =
In computer programming, a header file can be thought of as a dictionary a compiler uses if it comes across a word it does not understand. Mainly programming languages like C and C++ use this.
As you may know, a computer is really powerful. But it lacks the power to think and learn. As a result, a computer has to be fed each and every instruction for a task you may want done. But it is not practical to type in each and every instruction again and again for a task, especially if you tend to use it a lot. As a solution to this, header files are used. For example, consider the word "cout" which is used by C++ to display outputs on the screen. The computer, however, does not know what "cout" is. So, it checks if "cout" exists in a dictionary file (i.e. the header file) that has been mentioned by the programmer. If it finds what to do when someone says "cout", the program will be compiled properly. Otherwise, it will simply result in an error that so-and-so word has not been understood by the compiler.

= = = Oceanic whitetip shark = = =
The oceanic whitetip shark ("Carcharhinus longimanus"), is a large species of requiem shark, in the genus "Carcharhinus". The oceanic whitetip shark reaches a maximum length of four metres, and can weigh as much as 170 kg (370 pounds). This species of shark can be distinguished by its large, rounded first dorsal fin, and its long, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins.
The oceanic whitetip shark should not be confused with the whitetip reef shark.
Description.
The oceanic whitetip shark is easy to distinguish. It has a large, rounded first dorsal fin, and very long, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is very large with a rounded tip, and is just in front of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is located over, or slightly in front of, the anal fin. This species has a whitish-tipped first dorsal, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and caudal fin. The underside of the body is white, with a yellow tinge on some individuals.
Oceanic whitetip sharks can grow to large sizes, with the largest individuals reaching 3.5–4 metres (12–13 feet) in length. However, most specimens are less than 3 metres (10 feet) in length. The maximum recorded weight for this species is 170 kg (370 pounds). Males mature at 1.7-1.9 metres (5.6-6.2 feet) in length, while females reach maturity at slightly longer sizes of 1.8–2 metres (5.9-6.6 feet).
Habitat.
In the western Atlantic, the oceanic whitetip shark is found from Maine, U.S.A to Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. In the eastern Atlantic it is found from Portugal to the Gulf of Guinea, possibly occurring in the Mediterranean. In the Indo-Pacific, it is found from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahiti and Tuamoto islands. In the eastern Pacific it ranges from southern California to Peru, including the Galapagos Islands.
This shark is usually seen well offshore in deep water areas up to the depth of 152 metres (500 feet). On occasion it has been seen in shallower waters near land, usually near oceanic islands. Captured data in the Pacific Ocean shows that the abundance of this shark increases along with the distance from land. It is one of the top three most abundant oceanic sharks, with the blue shark and the silky shark.
Although this shark is mainly solitary, the oceanic whitetip shark gathers in groups when food is present. It is a slow swimmer, with equal amount of activity during the day and night. Reports show that the oceanic whitetip shark is usually found near the surface, swimming slowly with its pectoral fins spread widely. Oceanic whitetip sharks are often accompanied by remoras, dolphinfish, and pilot fish. An unusual behaviour was once observed in Hawaiian waters. The oceanic whitetip sharks were shown swimming along with pods of shortfin pilot whales. This behaviour was not fully understood, but was thought to be food-related. The oceanic whitetip sharks were thought to have been swimming with the pilot whales because the pilot whales were better at finding squid which the sharks also eat.
Behaviour.
The oceanic whitetip shark is mainly solitary and swims slowly, and is usually seen cruising near the top of the water column, covering large amounts of empty water, searching for prey or any food source. Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as "sea dogs". The oceanic whitetip shark, the most common ship-following shark, shows dog-like behaviour when it is attracted by something which appears to be food. It starts swimming greedily towards the food source, approaches cautiously but stubbornly. It keeps a safe distance if driven off, but is ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetip sharks are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. They commonly compete for food with silky sharks, often presenting aggressive displays. There does not seem to be segregation by gender and size. Oceanic whitetip sharks usually follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey.
Feeding.
The oceanic whitetip shark feeds mainly on bony fish, including lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, mackerels, and threadfins. Other prey consists of stingrays, sea turtles, sea birds, gastropods, squid, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion (dead whales and dolphins). Feeding behaviour has been reported for this shark and includes biting into schools of bony fish. It also swims through schools of feeding tuna with wide-open jaws, into which the tuna unknowingly swim. The oceanic whitetip shark has also been observed eating garbage that is disposed of at sea. If other species of sharks are encountered by the oceanic whitetip shark during feeding activities, the whitetip becomes aggressive and dominates over them.
Reproduction.
In the north-western Atlantic and the south-western Indian Ocean, the oceanic whitetip shark has been known to mate during the early summer. After a gestation period lasting around 1 year, the females give birth to around 1-15 pups. The oceanic whitetip shark is viviparous, and both genders reach maturity around the ages of 6–7 years, with the females being at a length of 1.8–2 metres (5.9-6.6 feet), and the males being at a length of 1.7-1.9 metres (5.6-6.2 feet). The young are around 60–65 cm long at birth.
Human interactions.
Oceanic whitetip sharks are usually caught by shark fisheries. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried-salted for human consumption, the skin is used for leather, the fins used in shark-fin soup, and the liver oil is used for vitamins. It is also processed into fishmeals. Tuna fishermen dislike the oceanic whitetip shark as it has been known to follow tuna boats and damage or consume catches. Although this species is usually seen offshore, it is considered to be dangerous. It is usually the first species to be seen in waters surrounding mid-ocean disasters. During World War II, the "Nova Scotia", a steamship, was sunk by torpedoes from a German submarine off the coast of South Africa. Close to 1,000 men were on board, however only 192 survived. It was believed that many of the fatalities were victims of the oceanic whitetip shark in what eyewitness accounts described as a feeding frenzy.
In encounters with divers, ocean whitetip sharks have shown little fear, and usually investigate and circle around the ongoing activities. Due to this shark's opportunistic feeding habits and strong jaws, as well as its boldness and unpredictability around divers, this shark should be treated with extreme caution. Many attacks are caused when divers accidentally bump into the shark.
Although this species is listed as 'vulnerable' overall, it has been listed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN in the north-western and western-central Atlantic. This is due to the massive decline in reported catches indicating that the population has decreased.

= = = Maine (province) = = =
Maine is one of the traditional provinces of France. It's capital was the city of Le Mans. The area is now divided into the departments of Sarthe and Mayenne.
History.
The Carolingians called Maine "pagis cenomannicus" after the Cenomani tribe that Julius Caesar had defeated. Pepin the Short gave the duchy of Maine to his half-brother Grifo.
In the last half of the 9th century, Maine took on greater importance because of invasions from Normandy and Brittany. In 924 King Rudolph of France gave Maine to Rollo of Normandy. Because it was next to Anjou on the south and Normandy on the north, these two duchies often fought over Maine.
William, Duke of Normandy invaded Maine in 1063 and he controlled the county by the beginning of 1064. Norman control of Maine helped make the southern border of Normandy safe against Anjou. This was a factor which allowed Duke William to launch his successful invasion of England in 1066.
In 1069 the citizens of Le Mans revolted against the Normans. Soon some of the Manceaux barons joined the revolt. The Normans were expelled in 1070, and young Hugh V was made the Count of Maine. After Norman attacks in 1073, 1088, 1098 and 1099, Elias I succeeded his cousin Hugh V, who sold Maine to him in 1092 for ten thousand shillings. His daughter married Fulk V, Count of Anjou, who took Maine over in 1110 after the death of Elias. Henri Beauclerc, agreed to recognize him as Count of Maine.
Fulk's son Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou inherited Maine. In 1051 it passed to Geoffrey's son Henry, Duke of Normandy (later King Henry I of England). Anjou, Maine and Normandy now had the same ruler for the first time. Henry later founded the Plantagenet dynasty in England.
The King of France, Philippe Auguste attacked the Plantagenet holdings called the Angevin Empire when it was held by John, King of England. In 1331 the Count of Maine became a peer of the realm.
After the battle of Verneuil in 1424, the English occupied Maine. They held Le Mans until 1448 and Fresnay until 1449. In 1481, Charles V of Anjou left his lands to Louis IX of France. This act returned the county to the crown of France.

Between 1996 and 2001, six "Creatures" games were released. 
The program was notable for being one of the first commercial products to create artificial-life animals using genetics, biochemistry and neural network brains. This meant that the Norns and their DNA could "evolve" in many different ways. By breeding certain Norns with others, some traits could be passed on to younger generations. The genetics in "Creatures" are slightly different from human genetics; they are haploid.

= = = Urban design = = =
Urban design is a subject of urban planning focusing on design of cities or other urban areas. Whereas architecture focuses on individual buildings, urban design is about the design of whole neighbourhoods and entire cities. It is about making them functional and attractive.
There are many problems that urban design tries to fix. One of them has to do with public health. One of the most talked about issues is about how easily people can walk to where they need to go. It became a bigger issue recently, not only because of the environment, but also because of people not being very healthy. Cities with a lot of gas cars hurt people. When people live around cars that blow smoke. people start to get really sick. People's hearts will beat in a weird way and it can lead to people dying. More people die from bad air each year than from getting hit by a car. That makes people want some changes. So they go out to say to people that the cities have to change. Instead of cars, they want cities to use trains for going really far, and they want cities to use bikes or buses to go not very far. Then they want people to be able to walk to any close by places. This would help public health double by getting rid of car smoke and getting people to walk more. This can help people's hearts beat normally and not let them die. It is also good exercise. There is evidence that cities can get people to walk more in them by having more open public spaces, stores within walking distance, grass, trees and other pleasing designs outside, and other things. It also helps with mental health, because people are more likely to talk to each other and that cuts down on loneliness.

= = = The Book of Tea = = =
 is a long essay about the role that tea plays in Japanese lifestyle and culture. It was written by Okakura Kakuzō, and was published in 1906.
The book is written for a Western audience. It was originally written in English. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was good at communicating his thoughts to Westerners. In his book, he discusses Zen and Taoism, but also the secular (non-religious) aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism (the art of tea) taught the Japanese many things. Most importantly it taught them simplicity. Kakuzō says that this simplicity, inspired by tea, affected arts and architecture.
Teaism.
When tea is more than a drink and the tea ceremony is understood and practiced to foster harmony in humanity, promote harmony with nature, discipline the mind, quiet the heart, and attain the purity of enlightenment, the art of tea becomes teaism. And it can be used to describe tea ceremony as the interests in tea culture and studies and pursued over time with self-cultivation. Teaism is mostly a simplistic mode of aesthetics, but there are subtle insights into ethics, and even metaphysics. Teaism is related to teamind. A sense of focus and concentration while under the influence of great tasting tea. Teaist is a person who performs or enjoys the art of tea and teaism. In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cultures, they all have well-developed teaism.
History.
Teaism is a synthesis of Taoism, Zennism, and tea. It is likely that it alludes more to the Taoist influences on Zen, and subsequently the Chado, or the Japanese tea ceremony, as he makes the statement, 'A subtle philosophy lay behind it all. Teaism was Taoism in disguise.' Teaism is brought out for its Taoist origins; but in the second half, it is shown through its manifestations in the Chado and in Japanese culture in general.
Terminology of dao/do with respect to tea.
In this sense tea is more than a drink and more than an art, it is integrated in the culture and the mind. The term Chinese:chadao or Japanese:chado in English is a difficult translation task. In most common use and easy to express translation is "tea ceremony". A direct translation is "the way of tea" or "the way of tea". The term "teaism" is by some only signifies this with Japanese tea ceremony. Similar terms are "tea arts" and "tea culture". While the word lore is usually not used in this context, another term used is tea lore.

= = = Breadboard = = =
A breadboard is an electron tool which can be used to test electrical circuits. Instead of using soldering to connect wires and components together (like on a perfboard or printed circuit board), they can be stuck into the holes of the breadboard. It has metal strips inside that will connect them, and it lets them be removed easily or moved around when testing a circuit. 
The rows and columns of holes on a breadboard are usually labelled with numbers and letters. Everything in a row with the same number will be connected, except if the breadboard has a strip down the center. In that case, the metal is split and the row has two separate connections (one on each side). The center strip is also useful when connecting integrated circuits, because they can be pushed in over the top of it and have legs connecting to both sides without overlapping the connections.
22 or 24 gauge wire usually work best to plug into the holes in a breadboard.

= = = Neville Bonner = = =
Neville Thomas Bonner AO (28 March 19225 February 1999) was an Australian politician, and the first Indigenous Australian member of the Parliament of Australia. He was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to fill a vacancy in the Senate. He later became the first Indigenous Australian to be elected to the parliament. Bonner was an elder of the Jagera people.
Biography.
Bonner was born on Ukerebagh Island, in the Tweed River in northern New South Wales. He never knew his father and had very little education. He worked on a farm, and in 1946 moved to Palm Island, near Townsville, Queensland. He became Assistant Settlement Overseer.
In 1960, he moved to Ipswich, and joined the board of directors of the One People of Australia League (OPAL). This was an indigenous rights organisation. He became its Queensland president in 1970. He joined the Liberal Party in 1967 and held local office in the party. Following the resignation of Liberal Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin in 1971, Bonner was chosen to replace her. He became the first indigenous Australian to sit in the Australian Parliament. He was elected in his own right in 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1980.
While in the Senate he served on a number of committees. He was never a serious candidate for promotion to the ministry. He rebelled against the Liberal Party policy on some issues. Partly as a result of this, and partly due to pressure from younger candidates, he was dropped from the Liberal Senate ticket at the 1983 election. He stood as an independent and was nearly successful. The Hawke government made him a director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Bonner was almost unique in being both an indigenous activist and a political conservative. He owed his political career to this combination. Other indigenous activists treated him badly, and they accused him of being a "token" in the Liberal Party.
In 1979, Bonner was jointly named Australian of the Year along with naturalist Harry Butler. In 1984, Bonner was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. From 1992 to 1996, he was member of the Griffith University Council. The university gave him an honorary doctorate in 1993. In 1998, he was elected to the Constitutional Convention as a candidate of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy. 
He died in Ipswich in 1999, at the age 76.
Posthumous honours.
The Neville Bonner Memorial Scholarship was set up by the Australian government in 2000. It gives money so that Indigenous Australians can study politics or related subjects at Australian universities.
The Queensland federal electorate of Bonner is named in his honour. A rugby league oval in Ipswich was named the Neville Bonner Sporting Complex in his honour. This oval was the home of an indigenous team, but is now the official home of the Queensland Cup team, the Ipswich Jets. The suburb of Bonner in Canberra, Australia's national capital, also bears his name. The head office of the Queensland Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services is named the "Neville Bonner Building".
Bonner was an active boomerang thrower. One of his boomerangs can be seen at the Old Parliament House in Canberra.

= = = Lowitja O'Donoghue = = =
Dr. Lowitja "Lois" O'Donoghue, (1 August 1932 – 4 February 2024) is an Aboriginal Australian woman who worked as an administrator of several Commonwealth organisations. She was the founding chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). She was named Australian of the Year in 1984.
Personal life.
Lowitja O'Donoghue was born at Granite Downs, a cattle station located on the Stuart Highway in northwest South Australia. Her father, Tom O'Donoghue, was a stockman of Irish descent. Her mother, Lily, was one of the native Yankunytjatjara people. Tom and Lily met while Tom was working at Everard Park, another cattle station on the traditional country of the Yankunytjatjara. The couple moved to Granite Downs, known as Indulkana to the Yankunytjatjara, in 1925. Lowitja was born here around 1 August 1932. She was the fifth of six children.
In 1934, members of the United Aborigines' Mission visited the community at Indulkana. They persuaded Lowitja's mother that it would be best for her children to be brought up by the missionaries. There was no school in Granite Downs, and they were concerned about raising their children in such an isolated location. They moved with their children to Oodnadatta, and took them to the mission, which was run by the Baptist Church. Lowitja was baptised at the mission by a pastor. She was taken to be taught at Colebrook Children's Home, an Aboriginal school run by the mission in Quorn. She began learning there at the age of three.
Lowitja was two years old when she was removed from her mother. After she was removed, she did not see her mother again for 33 years. During that time, her mother did not know where her children had been taken. Despite this, Lowitja did not identify as a member of the Stolen Generations. She would later say that she preferred the word "removed" over "stolen" for her personal case. She has said she was happy living at Colebrooke and that she received a good education both there and at the Quorn Primary School. However, it is these sort of assimilation practises by the Churches that Lowitja and many others would eventually work to put an end to.
In 1944, Colebrook Home moved to Eden Hills in the south of Adelaide due to very bad water shortages. This allowed Lowitja to go to Unley High School, a local public school.
In 1979, Lowitja married Gordon Smart, a health care worker at the Repatriation Hospital. She had first met him in 1964. He died in 1991, and was buried at Quorn.
Nursing career.
From 1950 to 1953, O'Donoghue worked as a nursing aide in Victor Harbor. The small local hospital did not run a training course. With the help of the matron, Lowitja applied to be a student nurse in Adelaide. The Royal Adelaide Hospital originally rejected her, but shortly afterwards she was offered a position as a student nurse in 1954. She qualified as a nurse and worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital until 1961.
She spent time as a nurse with the Baptist Church working in Assam, in northern India. She replaced missionaries who were taking leave back in Australia. Due to the nearby Sino-Indian War, she was advised by the Australian government to evacuate to Calcutta from where she returned to Australia.
Public service.
After returning in 1962, she worked as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer with the South Australian Department of Education. She later transferred to the state's Department of Aboriginal Affairs. She worked there as a Welfare Officer based mainly in the north of the state, including at Coober Pedy.
In 1967, Lowitja joined the newly formed Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which was in charge of Aboriginal welfare across Australia. She worked in the department's Adelaide office. After eight years, she became the Director of the department's office in South Australia. She was responsible for implementing the national Aboriginal welfare policy in South Australia. After a short while, she left the public service.
Lowitja was a chairperson of the National Aboriginal Congress for a short time in the early 1980s. She was later appointed chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission. In 1990, she was appointed chairperson of the newly created Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). In 1991, she, along with Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon, became the first Aboriginal people to attend a Cabinet meeting. In December 1992, she became the first Aboriginal Australian to address the United Nations General Assembly. She remained as chairperson of ATSIC until 1996. She was replaced by Gatjil Djerrkura, who was considered by the Howard Government to be more moderate.
Honours and awards.
In 1976, O'Donoghue was the first Aboriginal woman to be inducted into the new Order of Australia. The award was in recognition of her work in welfare. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983. She was named Australian of the Year in 1984, for her work to improve the welfare of indigenous Australians. She was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1999. O'Donoghue was inducted into the Olympic Order in 2000. She was made Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II in 2005.
O'Donoghue has received honorary doctorates from Murdoch University, the University of South Australia, the Australian National University, the Queensland University of Technology and Flinders University. She was made an honorary professorial fellow at Flinders University in 2000. 
Marriage and personal life.
In 1979 she married Gordon Smart, a medical orderly at the Repatriation Hospital, whom she had first met in 1964. He died in 1991 or 1992. He had six adult children from a previous marriage, but they had no children together.
On 4 February 2024 her family announced in a statement she had died in Adelaide, South Australia. O'Donoghue was 91.

Lesbianism has been performed in visual arts since the times of ancient Rome. For much of history of cinema and television, lesbianism was regarded as taboo. But since the 1960s, it has increasingly become a theme within its own right. It was first used in softcore movies and erotic thrillers during the 1980s. Acts of lovemaking between women first happened during several movies in the late 1960s: "The Killing of Sister George", "Therese and Isabelle" and "The Fox". Lesbian scenes during movies are always subject to controversy. Many people say that the MPAA has been harsh on movies with homosexual themes.

The first writings where the mountain is mentioned date from 949 with "Montis Canigonis" and "Monte Canigone" in Latin. The first written name of the mountain in Catalan ("Canigó") dates back to 1300, and from this comes "Canigou" in French.
The first ascent to Canigou was in 1285 by Peter III of Aragon, King of Aragon. This fact is mentioned in a chronicle written by Fra Salimbene, an Italian monk. It seems that the king did not go to the top of the peak.
Climate.
Although the dominant climate is largely Mediterranean at its base, the Canigou has several climate zones:
Although variable from one year to the next, snow is generally continuous over , from mid-November to late May. The mean temperature in July is and in January is .
Canigou Flame.
This mountain is a symbol for Catalan people. On its top there is a cross that is often decorated with the Catalan flag.
Every year on 23 June, the night before St. John's day ("nit de Sant Joan"), there is a ceremony called "Flama del Canigó" (Canigou Flame), where a fire is lit at the mountaintop. People spend the night there and take torches lit on that fire in a spectacular torch relay to light bonfires somewhere else. Some estimates conclude that about 30,000 bonfires are lit in this way all over Catalonia on that night.
Massif du Canigou.
The "Massif du Canigou" is a mountain range in the Pyrenees in the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales. It is the part of the Pyrenees nearest to the Mediterranean Sea.
There are two old monasteries at the foot of the mountain, "Martin-du-Canigou" and "Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa".
On 16 July 2012, the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France named the "Massif du Canigou" as a Grand Site of France.

= = = Foreign relations of Vanuatu = = =
Vanuatu has diplomatic relations with more than 65 countries. It has a very small network of embassies. Only Australia, France, New Zealand, and the People's Republic of China have embassies, high commissions, or missions in Port Vila. The British High Commission closed in 2005, after having been there for almost 100 years.
Concerns.
The government's main concern has been to improve the economy. It has a strong need for foreign aid, so Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1980, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand have provided most of Vanuatu's development aid.
Policies.
Vanuatu's foreign policy is fairly neutral. It stayed neutral during the Cold War. They have been a member of the Non-Aligned Movement since 1983. However, it has always given strong support for self-determination and decolonisation, especially throughout Melanesia. Vanuatu became independent from France and the United Kingdom in 1980. The first government recognised the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in November of the same year. It recognised the State of Palestine in August 1989. Later governments recognised Kosovo in 2010 and Abkhazia in 2011. Vanuatu has also supported the independence of New Caledonia and East Timor, and it strongly supports the Free Papua Movement in western New Guinea. Its relations with Indonesia have suffered because of this. Relations with Australia and New Zealand are a major focus of Vanuatu's foreign policy.
History.
Vanuatu established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1983, and Libya in 1986. It established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the United States in June and September 1986, respectively. Relations with the United States were bad until the late 1980s. Relations with France remained bad throughout the 1980s. Vanuatu under Walter Lini also tried to create strong relations with Asia. By the end of the 1980s, the country had established diplomatic relations with the China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines.
Australia and Vanuatu have very strong ties. Australia has given most of the help to Vanuatu's military. It is also Vanuatu's largest source of foreign investment, tourists, and foreign aid. Vanuatu also has strong ties to other Pacific countries. 
Memberships.
It is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, and several other regional organisations. It has been a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie since 1979. It was admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations in 1980 and to the United Nations in 1981. Vanuatu is currently the only Pacific nation that belongs to the Non-Aligned Movement.

= = = William Longsword = = =
William I Longsword ( – 17 December 942) was the second "Duke of Normandy". William added to his father's territories. He also began to expand Norman influence in West Francia (France). 
Early career.
William was born to the Viking Rollo and his Christian wife Poppa of Bayeux. He was born overseas probably in England.
 His mother was from a Frankish noble family. William was baptized a Christian probably at the same time as his father, William's nickname Longsword was probably earned during the fighting in 924–925 around Beauvais, Ponthieu and Amiens.
Duke of Normandy.
William succeeded his father as leader in 927 Early in his reign he faced a rebellion from by other Normans who did not think he was fit to lead them. The leader of this rebellion was Riouf of Évreux. At this same time William sent his wife Sprota to Fécamp where their son Richard was born.
In 933, William I Longsword swore to Raoul as King of Western Francia. In turn Raoul gave him lordship over much of the lands of the Bretons including Avranches and the Cotentin. But the Bretons fought to keep these lands. They were led by Alan II, Duke of Brittany and Count Berenger of Rennes. It ended shortly with Alan fleeing to England and Beranger seeking to be on friendly terms with the Normans. In 935, William arranged a marriage between his sister Adela and William, count of Poitou with the approval of Hugh the Great. At the same time William married Luitgarde, daughter of count Herbert II of Vermandois. Her dowry gave William the lands of Longueville, Coudres and Illiers l'Eveque. 
William Longsword attacked Flanders in 939 and Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, and Louis IV, King of France, attacked Normandy because of this. Arnulf captured the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer defeating Herluin, Count of Ponthieu. Herluin helped William Longsword to take back the castle. William was excommunicated for attacking and destroying lands belonging to Arnulf. William pledged his loyalty to King Louis IV when they met in 940. In return for this he was confirmed in lands that had been given to his father, Rollo. Almost three years later, on 17 December 942 at Picquigny on the Somme, William Longsword was attacked and killed by followers of Arnulf while at a peace conference to settle their differences.

The name motorway is used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and some other Commonwealth nations. In North America and Australia, the name freeway is used. In Germany, they are called Autobahns.
These kinds of highways can have four lanes or more. They carry many vehicles. They have no traffic-lights or ground level intersections. All roads crossing the highway go over a bridge or a tunnel. Ramps connect the highways to smaller roads and other highways. The place where highways meet these roads are called junctions or interchanges. Places where cars can leave or enter the motorway are called exits. Many freeways do not allow slower traffic, such as bicycles and pedestrians, to enter them.
Most controlled-access highways are divided with at least two lanes going each way, but they can be much wider in large cities.

= = = Art Clokey = = =
Arthur "Art" Clokey (October 12, 1921 – January 8, 2010) was an American animator. He was one of the first people to make stop motion clay animation popular. His work began in 1955 with a short movie called "Gumbasia". Clokey's work was influenced by his professor at the University of Southern California, Slavko Vorkapich. He and his wife Ruth later created the clay character Gumby. Gumby and his horse Pokey became popular characters on television. They first appeared in the "Howdy Doody Show", and later got their own series "The Adventures of Gumby".
Early life.
Clokey was born Arthur Charles Farrington in Detroit, Michigan. When he was nine years old, his parents divorced. He stayed with his father, Charles Farrington. After his father died in a car accident, he went to live with his mother in California. However, his stepfather refused to raise another man's son, and so Arthur was sent to an orphanage. When he was 11 or 12, he was adopted by Joseph W. Clokey. Clokey was a classical music composer and organist who taught music in Claremont, California. He taught Arthur painting, drawing, and filmmaking.
The name of Gumby comes from Arthur's childhood, when he would play with a clay and mud mixture called "gumbo".
Clay animation.
Before he made Gumby, Clokey did a few experiments with clay animation. Most of these were short movies for adults, including his first movie "Gumbasia". Clokey made this in 1953, and released it in 1955. It consisting of animated clay shapes dancing to jazz music. The title "Gumbasia" was named after Walt Disney's "Fantasia". In 1963, he made "The Clay Peacock". This was a reinvention of the animated NBC logo of the time. Clokey's third short movie was "Mandala" (6 minutes, 30 seconds). He made it from 1974-1977, and it was released on August 31, 1977. He described it as a metaphor for the evolving human consciousness. All three of these animations were later released to the public on several collections of "Gumby" television shorts.
"Gumbasia" caught the attention of Samuel G. Engel, president of the Motion Pictures Producers Association. He paid Clokey to make a short pilot for what became "The Gumby Show" (1957). In 1995, Clokey worked with Dallas McKennon to make "", a full-length movie. It was not very successful. In the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon signed a contract with Art Clokey to show every episode of "Gumby". It was on top of their ratings for over three years.
Clokey's second most-famous work was the "Davey and Goliath" cartoon.
Death.
Clokey died on January 8, 2010, at his home in Los Osos, California. He was 88 years old. He had been suffering from a infection of the bladder.

= = = Bartlett's Familiar Quotations = = =
Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (often called just Bartlett's) is an American reference book. It is a collection of quotations. The book was first printed in 1855. Its eighteenth edition was published in 2012.
The quotations are listed by the name of the writer. That is different from other books of quotations that list by subject. The writers are listed by date of birth, not alphabetically. Quotations are arranged in order by time within each writer's entry. The book has an index of the main words used in the quotations. It gives the source of each quotation.
History.
John Bartlett ran the University Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. People often asked him for information on quotations. He began a book of them for reference. In 1855, he privately printed his book as "A Collection of Familiar Quotations". This first edition had 258 pages of quotations by 169 authors. Many of the quotations were from the Bible, William Shakespeare, and the great English poets.
The book was a great success. Bartlett issued three more editions before joining the Boston publishing firm of Little, Brown, and Company. Bartlett supervised nine editions of the work before his death in 1905.
The tenth edition (1914) was edited by Nathan Haskell Dole. It began with quotations originally in English. Most of these quotes were from literary sources. After those, there was a section of quotations from politicians and scientists (such as "fifty-four forty or fight!"). After that, there was a section of translated quotations. Those were mostly from the ancient Greeks and Romans. The last section had quotations from the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Quotations were arranged in a single column.
The eleventh edition (1937) was edited by Christopher Morley (1890–1957) and Louella D. Everett. It had bigger pages and a two-column format. That is more like the format used today. A twelfth edition (1948) was also edited by Morley and Everett.
The thirteenth edition (1955) was called the "Centennial Edition." It was credited to the editors of Little, Brown, but the preface gives special thanks to Morley, Everett, and Emily Morison Beck (1915–2004). This edition included more recent quotations. The two youngest people quoted were cartoonist Bill Mauldin and Queen Elizabeth II. Beck also edited the fourteenth edition (1968) and the fifteenth (1980).
After Beck's retirement, Little, Brown made Justin Kaplan the editor for the sixteenth edition (1993). His book about Mark Twain, "Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain", had won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. Kaplan was criticized for including only three minor Ronald Reagan quotations in this edition, and for saying publicly that he despised Reagan. (Franklin D. Roosevelt had 35 entries and John F. Kennedy had 28.) Kaplan was also criticized for including pop culture material.
The seventeenth edition (2003) had similar criticism. It included entries for the first time from J.K. Rowling, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David. Classic quotations were cut, including eleven quotations by Alexander Pope. Kaplan did include six Reagan quotations. He told "USA Today" "I admit I was carried away by prejudice. Mischievously I did him dirty."
The eighteenth edition (2012) was edited by poet, critic, and editor Geoffrey O'Brien. O'Brien is also the editor-in-chief of the Library of America.

= = = Richard I, Duke of Normandy = = =
Richard I of Normandy (933–996), also known as Richard the Fearless (French, "Sans Peur"), was the "Duke of Normandy" from 942 to 996. Richard made Normandy into a feudal society where he owned all the land. His followers held on to the lands given them by remaining loyal to him. He made Normandy a much stronger a power in western France. 
Early Career.
Richard was the son of William Longsword, princeps or ruler of Normandy. His mother's name was Sprota. She was a Breton prisoner captured in war who William later married. William Longsword was told of the birth of a son after the battle with Riouf and other viking rebels. But he kept this a secret until a few years later. When he first met his son he kissed him and made him the heir to Normandy. William then sent Richard to be cared for in Bayeux.
When his father died, Richard was only 10 years old (he was born in 933). King Louis IV of France decided to take charge of Normandy himself. The king placed the young duke in the custody of the count of Ponthieu. Then the king gave the lands in lower Normandy to Hugh the Great. Louis kept Richard a prisoner at Lâon. Fearing the king was going to harm the boy Osmond de Centville, Bernard de Senlis (who had been a companion of Richard's grandfather Rollo), Ivo de Bellèsme, and Bernard the Dane freed Richard.
Duke of Normandy.
In 946, Richard agreed to be a ward of Hugh, Count of Paris. He then allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders. Together they drove Louis out of Rouen and took back Normandy by 947. In 962 Theobald I, Count of Blois, attacked Rouen. But Richard's army defeated them. Lothair king of West Francia stepped in to prevent any more war between the two. For the rest of his reign Richard chose not to make Normandy bigger. Instead he worked on making Normandy stronger.
Richard used marriages to build strong alliances. His marriage to Emma gave him a connection to the Capet family. His wife Gunnor was from a rival Viking group in the Cotentin. His marriage to her gave him support from her family. Her sisters married several of Richard's loyal followers. Also Richard's daughters provided valuable marriage alliances with powerful counts as well as to the king of England. Richard also made sure the church and the great monasteries were doing well. His reign was marked by a long period of peace and tranquility. Richard died in Fecamp, Normandy, on 20 November 996.
Marriages.
William married first (960)to Emma, daughter of Hugh "The Great" of France. They were promised to each other when both were very young. She died after 19 March 968, before they had any children.
Richard had children with his concubine Gunnora. Richard later married her to make their children legitimate:
Illegitimate Children.

It got its name "Constantia" in 298 during the reign of Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus. Under the Carolingians it became known as the Cotentin and was controlled by viscounts. For some time these were members of the Saint-Sauveur family. They lived at Saint-Sauveur on the Douve river.
In the ninth century, Vikings settled the Cotentin, which became part of Normandy in the early tenth century. Many place names there come from the Norse language. Examples include La Hague, and La-Hougue both derived from the Old Norse word "haugr" meaning a hill or mound. Until the construction of modern roads, the peninsula was almost inaccessible in winter because of marshland cutting off the higher ground. This explains occasional historical references to the Cotentin as an island.
King Alan the Great of Brittany waged war successfully on the Norsemen. As the result of his conquests, the Cotentin Peninsula was included in the territory of the Duchy of Brittany. After his death, the Norsemen invaded and occupied Brittany from 907 to 939. While they were eventually expelled by Alan's grandson, Alan II, Duke of Brittany, the subsequent rulers of Brittany were weaker than Alan the Great. The succeeding Dukes of Brittany suffered continuing Norse invasions and Norman raids. Eventually the Cotentin Peninsula was lost to the Brittany, and became part of Normandy.
In 1088 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, gave the Cotentin to his brother Henry, later King Henry I of England. Henry, as count of the Cotentin, established his first power base there and in the adjoining Avranchin to the south During the Hundred Years' War, King Edward III of England landed in the bay of La Hogue, and then came to the Church of Quettehou in Val de Saire. It was there that Edward III knighted his son Edward, the Black Prince. A remembrance plaque can be seen next to the altar. The naval Battle of La Hogue in 1692 was fought off Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue near Barfleur.
The town of Valognes was, until the French Revolution, a provincial social resort for the , nicknamed the "Versailles of Normandy". The social scene was described in the novels of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly (himself from the Cotentin). The grand houses and châteaux; were destroyed during World War II.
During World War II, part of the 1944 Battle of Normandy was fought in the Cotentin. The westernmost part of the D-Day landings was at Utah Beach, on the southeastern coast of the peninsula. What followed was a campaign to occupy the peninsula and take Cherbourg.
Economy.
The main economical resource is agriculture. Dairy farming is a prominent activity. Along the west coast, renowned vegetables are grown, such as the carrots of Créances. The renowned trademark "Florette" was created in Lessay. The region is also famous for its shellfish culture. These include oysters from Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and Pirou. Other products are alcoholic beverages like cider and calvados, made from locally grown apples and pears.
The region hosts two important Nuclear power plants. At Flamanville there is the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. The other is the COGEMA La Hague site. It is a large nuclear waste reprocessing and storage complex operated by Areva NC. The nuclear power industry provides many jobs in the region. The roads used for transport of nuclear waste have been blocked many times in the past by environmental action group Greenpeace. Local environmental groups have voiced concerns about the radioactivity levels of the cooling water of both these nuclear sites. These are being flushed into the bay of Vauville. However, the radioactivity is much lower than the natural background levels and does not pose any hazard.
There are two important naval shipyards in Cherbourg. The state-owned shipyard DCNS has built French nuclear submarines since the 1960s. Privately owned CMN builds frigates and patrol vessels for various states, mostly from the Middle East. Tourism is also an important economic activity in this region. Many tourists visit the D-Day invasion beaches, including Utah Beach in the Cotentin. At Sainte-Mère-Église a few miles away from the beach, there is a museum dedicated to the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division. The "Cité de la Mer" in Cherbourg is a museum of oceanic and underseas subjects. The main attraction is "Redoutable", the first French nuclear submarine, launched in 1967.
Culture.
Due to its relative isolation the Cotentin is one of the last remaining places the Norman language is spoken. The Norman language writer Alfred Rossel, native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel's song "Sus la mé" ("on the sea") is often sung as a regional patriotic song.

It was abolished in 1906 when the boundaries were redrawn and mostly replaced by the Division of Batman.
Members.
The division was held by one member, H. B. Higgins. Higgins was Attorney General from 1904 to 1905. He was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Australia in 1906. Isaac Selby, who was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1901 election, became famous in 1905 when he tried to shoot a judge during a court case in San Francisco.

= = = List of soups = = =
Soups have been made since ancient times. This page lists a selection of well-known soups from the various cuisines around the world. They are sorted by the type of soup.
Some soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid; these are categorised below as "chunky". A broth is a flavoured liquid usually made from boiling a meat and bone or vegetable for a period of time in a stock. A common type of broth is consommé. A potage is a category of thick soups, stews or porridges. In some of them, meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they turn into a thick mush.
Bisques are creamy soups traditionally made with shellfish, but can be made with any type of seafood. The base of cream soups is dairy. Chowders are thick soups usually containing some type of starch. Coulis were originally meat juices, and now are thick purees. Some soups are only ever served cold, and other soups can be served cold as an option.

= = = Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy = = =
Fedor Jeftichew, better known as Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy (1868 - January 31, 1904) was a Russian sideshow performer. Like his father, Adrien, with whom he performed, Jo-Jo was afflicted with hypertrichosis, an abnormal growth of hair over the face and body. Jo-Jo was covered with long, silky hair and was said to resemble a Skye terrier.
Jo-Jo was born in St Petersburg, Russia in 1868. He began touring Europe in 1873. He was five feet eight inches tall, had only four or five teeth, and spoke Russian, German, and a little English. He dressed like a Russian cavalryman. He would bark at an audience, and would perform as often as 23 times a day. In 1886, he was making US$500 a week.
Jo-Jo toured Europe and Russia, playing in fairgrounds. He was discovered by Charles Reynolds in London, England. Jo-Jo was performing with his father, Adrien, who resembled a poodle. Reynolds realized the Dog-Faced Boy could be presented in a more professional manner. He took the boy to the United States on the "City of Chicago" on 12 October 1884.
A press conference was called. Journalists were allowed to pull Jeftichew's hair to be assured it was real and not pasted on. The "New York Herald" described Jeftichew as "the most extraordinary and absorbingly interesting curiosity that has ever reached these shores."
In 1884, Jeftichew signed with P. T. Barnum. Barnum stated (falsely) that Jo-Jo was captured by a hunter in the wilds of central Russia. Barnum advertised him as "the most prodigious paragon of all prodigies secured by P. T. Barnum in fifty years. The Human Skye Terrier, the crowning mystery of nature's contradictions."
He toured Europe with Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth in 1901 and 1902. He died in Greece in 1904 while on tour of pneumonia. He was the subject of a song recorded by Annette Funicello in the 1960s and was referenced in an episode of the television series, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".

= = = Sample = = =
In statistics, a sample is part of a population. The sample is carefully chosen. It should represent the whole population fairly, without bias.
When treated as a data set, a sample is often represented by capital letters such as formula_1 and formula_2, with its elements being represented in lowercase (e.g., formula_3), and the sample size being represented by the letter formula_4.
The reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical. Therefore, solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling. Sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis. As an example, suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study. Depending on where the samples of water were taken, the studies can have different results. 
As a general rule, samples need to be random. This means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual.
In practice, random samples are always taken by means of a well-defined procedure. A procedure is a set of rules, a sequence of steps written down and exactly followed. Even so, some bias may remain in the sample. Consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election poll. All known methods have their problems, and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample. If you collect opinions by using telephones, or by meeting people in the street, you won't ask people who don't answer phone calls or who don't walk on the street. Therefore, in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible. In such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias, and there are ways to estimate this.
A similar situation occurs when scientists measure a physical property, say the weight of a piece of metal, or the speed of light. If we weigh an object with sensitive equipment we will get minutely different results. No system of measurement is ever perfect. We get a series of estimates, each one being a measurement. These are samples, with a certain degree of error. Statistics is designed to describe error, and carry out analysis on this kind of data.
There are different kinds of samples:
The way the sampling is obtained, along with the sample size, will have an impact on how the data is viewed.
Stratified sampling.
If a population has obvious sub-populations, then each of the sub-populations needs to be sampled. This is called "stratified sampling". Stratified sampling is also known as "stratified random sample". Stratified sampling is often represented as proportion, such as percent (%).
Suppose an experiment set out to sample the incomes of adults. Obviously, the incomes of college graduates might differ from that of non-graduates. Now suppose the number of male graduates was 30% of the total male adults (imaginary figures). Then you would arrange for 30% of the total sample to be male graduates picked at random, and 70% of the total to be male non-graduates. Repeat the process for females, because the percentage of female graduates is different from males. That gives a sample of the adult population stratified by sex and college education. The next step would be to divide each of your sub-populations by age groups, because (for example) graduates might gain more income relative to non-graduates in middle age.
Another type of stratified sample deals with variation. Here larger samples are taken from the more variable sub-populations so that the summary statistics such as the means and standard deviations, are more reliable.

= = = Hugh the Great = = =
Hugh the Great or Hugues le Grand (895–16 June 956) was duke of the Franks and count of Paris.
Early career.
Hugh was the son of King Robert I of France and Béatrice of Vermandois. She was the daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois. Hugh was born in 895 in Paris, France. His eldest son was Hugh Capet who became King of France in 987. Hugh was a member of the family known as the Robertians.
Duke of France.
In 922 the barons of western Francia revolted against the Carolingian king Charles the Simple. In his place they elected Robert I, Hugh's father, as King of Western Francia. Robert I died in battle at Soissons in 923. When Hugh refused the crown it went to his brother-in-law, Rudolph of France. Charles the simple asked his cousin Herbert II, Count of Vermandois for help in getting back his crown. But instead of helping the king he put him in prison. Herbert then used the threat of releasing his prisoner to get what he wanted. But Charles died in 929. From then on Hugh the great, acting for King Rudolph, had to struggle with Herbert II. Finally Rudolph and Herbert II came to an agreement in 935.
At the death of King Rudolph in 936, Hugh possessed nearly all of the region between the Loire and the Seine. This was the same territory as Neustria with the exceptions of Anjou and of Normandy. Hugh was one of those who brought Louis IV ("d'Outremer") from the Kingdom of England in 936. In 937 Hugh married Hedwige of Saxony, a daughter of Henry I the Fowler of Germany and Matilda of Ringelheim. Very soon however Hugh was quarrelling with King Louis.
In 939 king Louis attacked Hugh the Great and William I, Duke of Normandy. But soon after they made a truce which lasted until June. That same year Hugh, along with Herbert II of Vermandois, Arnulf I, Count of Flanders and Duke William Longsword paid homage to the Emperor Otto the Great. They supported him in his struggle against Louis. When Louis fell into the hands of the Normans in 945, he was handed over to Hugh in exchange for their young duke Richard. Hugh released Louis IV in 946 but made him surrender the fortress of Laon. In 948 at a church council at Ingelheim the bishops excommunicated Hugh even though he was not there. Hugh's response was to attack Soissons and Reims. Hugh finally changed his mind and made peace with Louis IV, and the church.
When Louis IV died Hugh was one of the first to recognize Lothair as his successor. For helping to have him crowned the new king gave Hugh Burgundy and Aquitaine. In the same year Giselbert, Duke of Burgundy acknowledged Hugh as his overlord and gave his daughter in marriage to Hugh's son Otto-Henry. On 16 June 956 Hugh the Great died in Dourdan.
Family.

= = = Richard II, Duke of Normandy = = =
Richard II (23 August 963 - 28 August 1026), called the Good (French: "Le Bon"), was the Duke of Normandy from 996 to 1026. He was the first to assume the title of duke and built up his court to resemble that of a king. He commissioned Dudo of Saint-Quentin to write a detailed history of the Norman Dukes showing their and Christian patronage.
Early career.
Richard II was the oldest son of Richard I the Fearless and Gunnora. He succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy in 996. During his minority, which was the first five years of his reign, his was his uncle Count Ralph of Ivrea. Ralph put down a peasant revolt at the start of Richard's reign.
Richard was very religious like his overlord king Robert II of France. Richard used his army to support the king against the duchy of Burgundy. He formed a marriage alliance with Brittany by marrying his sister Hawise of Normandy to Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany. It became a double alliance when he married Geoffrey's sister, Judith of Brittany.
Vikings and England.
In the 980s the Vikings had been raiding England again. They would then cross the English Channel to Normandy to sell their plunder. Norman and Viking relations were good. Richard's father had hired Viking mercenaries in the 960s. He also allowed them safe haven in Normandy. This caused problems in England and with the Pope in Rome. In 990 representatives of the Pope negotiated a treaty between England and Normandy. Richard I agreed not to aid enemies of England (including Vikings). From 997 to 1000 a great Viking army attacked Wessex a number of times. In 1000 they came to Normandy and were allowed to land by Richard II. This broke the treaty between his father and the English king. In 1000-1001 the English attacked Normandy on the Cotentin Peninsula. The raid was led by king Ethelred the Unready of England. Ethelred had given orders that Richard be captured, shackled and brought to England. But the English were not prepared for the rapid response of the Norman cavalry and were quickly defeated.
Richard wanted to make peace with the English king. He gave his sister Emma of Normandy in marriage to King Ethelred. Ethelred gave Emma the city of Exeter as a dowry. This turned out to be an important marriage as it later gave Richard's grandson, William the Conqueror, a claim to the throne of England. In 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard invaded England, Emma with her two sons Edward and Alfred fled to Normandy. After losing his throne King Ethelred followed shortly. Soon after the death of Ethelred, Cnut, King of England forced Emma to marry him. Duke Richard was forced to recognize the new regime as his sister was again Queen. 
Norman prestige.
Richard II commissioned Dudo of Saint-Quentin, his clerk and priest, to write about his ancestors. He was to tell the story of the Norman dukes in a way that showed their Christian morals. He wanted them shown to be good and upright leaders who built Normandy despite the bad behavior of their Frankish neighbors. It has been called by some historians a work of propaganda. While it contains a number of stories and legends, nowhere did Dudo claim the stories to be facts. When he wrote his work on the Customs and Deeds of the First Dukes of the Normans, Dudo seems to have met his goal "to tell in the noblest style the story of a noble destiny."
In 1025 and 1026 Richard confirmed gifts of his ancestor Rollo to Saint-Ouen at Rouen. He gave many other gifts to Monasteries. Their names show the areas over which Richard had ducal control: Caen, the Éverecin, the Cotentin, the Pays de Caux and Rouen.
Richard II died 28 Aug 1026.

= = = The Well-Tempered Clavier = = =
The Well-Tempered Clavier (also known as WTC, BWV 846–893) is the title of two collections of musical works for solo keyboard instruments by the Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach. The first collection was written in 1722 and the second was written in 1742, but they were not published until 1801, fifty years after Bach died. Although the music was written for the harpsichord, which was popular at the time, today it is usually played and heard on a piano.
Both collections have 24 short preludes and 24 fugues to go along with it. All of them contrast with each other: some of them are easy to learn, while others are hard to follow (because there are many different melodies going on at the same time, which is called counterpoint). What is special about them is that each prelude and fugue is written in a different major or minor key. They appear in the book so that they go up by semitones. That is, the first prelude and fugue is in C major, the second is in C minor, the third in C-sharp major (or D-flat major), the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on, until the last two preludes and fugues are in B major and B minor, in that order.
Other composers would later write music that is also in all 24 major and minor keys. The best known of these are the Preludes by Frédéric Chopin, but this would also later be done by Charles-Valentin Alkan, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Dmitri Shostakovich, to name a few.
Some of the music that appears in "The Well-Tempered Clavier" has become famous. For example, the French Romantic composer Charles Gounod wrote a setting of Ave Maria that is based on the melody of the first Prelude in C Major in the "WTC".

Systems respond differently to inputs of different frequencies. Some systems may amplify frequencies of certain range and attenuate the other frequencies. The way that the system output is related to the input for different frequencies is called frequency response. Frequency response means a graph where can be seen how something changes in different sound frequency. It is typically used in loudspeakers. Also audio crossovers way to function can be shown with frequency response.
The frequency response will be represented by two numbers and measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the unit of measurement for one frequency cycle. The first number represents the lowest bass frequency while the second number indicates the highest high-frequency an audio product can produce.

= = = Sukhoi Su-25 = = =

= = = Audio crossover = = =
Audio crossover is an electric circuit that separates low and high audio frequencies in a signal. It is needed because very small loudspeakers (tweeters) would break if fed by low frequencies. Likewise, bigger speakers (subwoofers) are not able to play higher frequencies purely.
Audio crossovers are divided to passive or active crossovers. Typical components used with passive crossovers are capacitors inductors and resistors. If passive crossover uses resistors to adjust loudness, those generate heat. Instead, active devices typically use resistors and capacitors with other audioelectronic components and those typically don't consume so much electric power. Also, active crossovers are easily built to be adjustable. Still, that doesn't mean that using passive crossover means low quality.

= = = Gunnora = = =
Gunnora (or Gunnor) (–), "Duchess" of Normandy, was the wife of Richard I, Duke of Normandy. She was an important figure in his reign and those of her sons.
Career.
Gunnora belonged to a family from the Pays de Caux area in Normandy. Gunnora was probably born . Her family was very influential in western Normandy and Gunnora was said to be very wealthy. Her marriage to Richard I was of great political importance. It allied him with a powerful rival family in the Cotentin. Her brother, Herfast de Crepon, was the of a great Norman family. Her sisters and nieces married some of the most important nobles in Normandy. 
At the time the Normans were used to more than one kind of marriage. Richard I wanted his son Robert to become the Archbishop of Rouen. He was told the church would not allow it because he and Gunnora were not married in a Christian ceremony. So he married Gunnora "according to the Christian custom", making their children legitimate in the eyes of the church.
Gunnora signed many ducal charters up into the 1020s. She was skilled in languages and had an excellent memory. She was a source of information on Norman history for Dudo of St. Quentin. Her husband depended on her as is shown in the couple's charters where she held several important positions. She was at times regent of Normandy, a and a judge. In a typical roll for a medieval aristocratic mother, she was an between her husband and their oldest son Richard II. As Richard I's widow she is mentioned as being active in her sons' careers. 
Gunnora was a founder and of Coutances Cathedral and laid its first stone. In one of her own charters after Richard's death she gave two pieces of land (called allods) to the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel. These were Britavilla and Domjean which were part of her dowry. She gave them for the soul of her husband, for her own soul and that of her sons "count Richard, archbishop Robert, and others..." She also signed a charter, , to that same abbey as "Gonnor matris comitis" (Gunnor, mother of the count). Gunnora, as wife and countess, was able to use her influence to see her kin favored, and several of the most prominent Anglo-Norman families on both sides of the English Channel are descended from her, her sisters and her nieces. Gunnora died .
Family.
Richard and Gunnora were parents to several children:

The Boulton Paul Defiant was a British fighter aircraft. This single-engine, aircraft first in August 1937 and was used by the British Royal Air Force in World War II. 
Defiants were different to other fighter planes because their guns (four Machine guns) were in a rotating turret and could fire in any direction. They had two crew: one man was the pilot and the other aimed the guns.
Defiants were made to shoot down enemy bomber aircraft. When they were used during the Battle of Britain, they were good at this. But they were slower and could not turn as well as German fighter planes, like the Messerschmitt Bf 109. A lot of Defiants were shot down by German fighters.
After the Battle of Britain, the British only flew Defiants at night. In this way they could attack the German bombers that also flew at night, and avoid the German fighters because they only flew during the day. 
Today, only one Defiant is left in the world; it is in a museum in London.

= = = Shemini Atzeret = = =
Shemini Atzeret ( – "the Eighth [day] of Assembly") is a Jewish holiday of the (Northern Hemisphere) autumn. In Israel, the date of the holiday is 22 Tishrei on the Hebrew calendar. Outside of Israel, it is two days long, on 22-23 Tishrei. On the Gregorian calendar, Shemini Atzeret comes in late September or early or middle October.
The holiday is best known for the celebration of Simchat Torah (�������� �������), "Rejoicing of the Torah", when Jews finish the annual cycle of reading the whole Torah out loud in synagogue. Outside Israel, "Simchat" Torah is celebrated on the second day of the holiday. Most people outside Israel use the name "Shemini Atzeret" for the first day only. They call the second day "Simchat Torah" because of this celebration. In Israel, the one day of the holiday is called by both names.
In some ways, this holiday is part of the holiday of Sukkot. The "shemini" ("8th") is the "8th day" of Sukkot. In other ways, this holiday is a separate holiday on its own, and not part of Sukkot. 
Shemini Atzeret is an important Jewish holiday. Like on Shabbat and other important Jewish holidays, work is not allowed on Shemini Atzeret.
Sources in the Torah.
The holiday of Shemini Atzeret is in the Torah (Pentateuch) twice, at and at . The Torah does not say much about the holiday, though.
Shemini Atzeret and Sukkot.
The Torah says that this holiday falls on the eighth day of Sukkot. However, in the same paragraph, the celebrations of Sukkot are described as lasting "seven" days, not eight. The Talmud writes about this apparent(def. 2) problem. At the end of the section, the Talmud says that at the same time,
The laws and customs of Shemini Atzeret show both pieces of the holiday.
How Shemini Atzeret is celebrated.
Some Jewish holidays have special rituals, like the Seder of Passover or the sukkah, lulav and etrog of Sukkot. In the Torah, there are no rituals like that for Shemini Atzeret. But starting at the time of the Talmud, Shemini Atzeret became the holiday for finishing the annual reading of the Torah in the synagogue. The celebration of that—called Simchat Torah— has become the main feature(def. n2) of the holiday.
Simchat Torah.
In synagogues, one section of the Torah is read on every Shabbat of the year. The last section, from Deuteronomy, is read on the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Over the last 1000 years, the reading of the last section has become a big celebration called Simchat Torah, or "Rejoicing of the Torah". This celebration is so important that the whole day of the celebration is called "Simchat Torah." In Israel, this celebration happens on the single day of the holiday, 22 Tishrei. Outside of Israel, it happens on the second of the two days, 23 Tishrei.
History.
The name "Simchat Torah" does not appear in the Torah or the Talmud. The Talmud says that the final section of the Torah is read on Shemini Atzeret. But it does not use the name Simchat Torah, and it does not describe a special celebration. The first reference to any kind of celebration comes from the perioddef. "n1" of the "Geonim" (7th-11th centuries CE). That source mentioned the custom of dancing with the Torah, which is still a custom today.
In modern times, Simchat Torah has become a day to show Jewish pride in public. 
Simchat Torah evening.
Simchat Torah evening is a wikt:festive and child-friendly holiday. After the regular holiday evening prayers, all the Torahs are taken from the wikt:ark. Members of the synagogue march or dance around the synagogue seven times with the Torahs. Each time around the synagogue, the people pray "Save us! Answer us on the day we call!" Sometimes the dancing moves from the synagogue to the street outside. Sometimes the dancing can go late into the evening, with extra songs and prayers added. One very common custom is for people—especially children—to march or dance with flags, sometimes with candles or apples on top. At the end of the dancing in most synagogues, a piece of the last Torah portion in Deuteronomy is read in public. In Orthodox and Conservative synagogues, the very end of Deuteronomy is not read at night. But in Reform synagogues, it sometimes is.
Simchat Torah morning.
After the regular holiday morning prayers, the dancing and marching of the previous night are repeated. After that, every wikt:eligible adult member of the synagogue is called to the Torah for an "aliyah" (honor), says blessings, and has several verses of the Torah read. Depending on the size of the synagogue, this can take a long time. Different synagogues have different ways to do this:
Once all eligible adults have received an honor, the celebration comes to its highest point. The last three honors go to distinguished members of the synagogue:
For all of these honors, the person honored stands under a "tallit" (prayer ) held open like the "ḥuppa," or , in a Jewish wedding.
"Hakafot Shniyot".
In Israel, it has become common to add an extra night of celebration to Simchat Torah. This is called "Hakafot Shniyot" (Second Circuits). It happens on 23 Tishrei, the same night as Jews in the rest of the world celebrate Simchat Torah. This is a way for Jews around the world to show Jewish pride together. Because the holiday of Shemini Atzeret is over after one day in Israel, holiday restrictions do not apply. So "Hakafot Shniyot" can include things not normally allowed on Shabbat and Jewish holidays (like bands and photography).
Practices from Sukkot.
The Torah states that it is a requirement for Jews to be happy on Sukkot. The Talmud writes that this requirement lasts for eight days—the seven days of Sukkot "and" Shemini Atzeret. As part of this, Hallel is said in synagogue during the morning prayers of Shemini Atzeret.
In Israel, this is the only practice from Sukkot that continues into Shemini Atzeret. In every other way Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday with separate practices.
Outside Israel, this is complicated by the Jewish law of adding an extra day to every Biblical Jewish holiday except Yom Kippur. The holiday of Sukkot, which lasts seven days in Israel lasts eight days outside Israel. But the eighth day is also the first day of the separate holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Sometimes the rules for the two holidays conflict. Figuring out the conflicts can be complicated. But the general rule is that 
In practice, what happens "only outside of Israel" is that
None of this happens on the second day of Shemini Atzeret (Simchat Torah), because it is no longer an extra day of Sukkot.

= = = Richard III, Duke of Normandy = = =
Richard III (997/1001 – 6 August 1027) was the Duke of Normandy. His short reign of one year opened with a rebellion by his younger brother Robert I and ended with his death.
Early career.
Richard III was the oldest son of Richard II, Duke of Normandy and his wife Judith of Brittany. He was born . Around the year 1120, Richard's father sent him in command of a large army to rescue his brother-in-law, Reginald I, Count of Burgundy. It was a distance of about 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Normandy. Richard III's capture of the castle of Minamde was enough to convince Bishop Hugh to surrender and release Reginald.
When his father died in August of 1026, as the oldest son, Richard III succeeded him as Duke of Normandy. By all accounts Richard III was accepted by the barons of Normandy and had no problems accepting his new role as duke. Richard III had given his younger son, Robert, the town of Exmes and the county of Hiemois. But once Richard III became duke, his younger brother Robert was not satisfied. He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. He also captured his brother's city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised to be faithful.
Richard III then took the next step; he arranged with king Robert II of France to marry his young daughter, Adelis. She was given rich dowry which included the city and county of Coutances. Even though he was now newly married to a king's daughter, he already had children by a concubine. But unexpectedly Richard III died on 5 or 6 August 1027. He had a son named Nicholas, but the boy was immediately sent to the at Fécamp. With Nicholas out of the way the duchy passed to his Richard III's younger brother Robert, who became the sixth duke of Normandy as Robert I.
Marriage.
In January of 1027 he was married to Adela a younger daughter of Robert II of France and Constance of Arles. After Richard's death Adela secondly married Baldwin V, Count of Flanders.
Issue.
By his wife Adela he had no children.
By an unknown concubine he had at least two children:

= = = Celestial coordinate system = = =
A celestial coordinate system is a coordinate system that helps astronomers specify the location of objects in the sky. These objects may be stars, planets or even satellites. There are several such coordinate systems listed below. All of them are spherical.
The fundamental plane divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the equator in the geographic coordinate system. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates.
Coordinate systems.
These are common coordinate systems used by the astronomical community:
Horizontal system.
The horizontal system is based on the position of the observer on Earth. It is a useful coordinate system for finding and tracking objects for observers on Earth. It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's true or ideal horizon.
Equatorial system.
The equatorial coordinates are based on the position of stars relative to the Earth's equator. Imagine the Earth's equator extended out to an infinite distance. The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the solar system. "Modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates".
Eclyptic system.
The fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, also called the ecliptic plane. There are two versions: the geocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the Earth, and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the centre of mass of the solar system.
The geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.
The heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centres on the barycenter of the solar system. This is very close to the centre of the Sun). The system is mainly used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, and their orbits.
Galactic system.
The galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane. The solar system is still the centre of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic centre. 'Galactic latitude' means, roughly, the elevation above the galactic plane. 'Galactic longitude' is the direction relative to the centre of the galaxy.
Supergalactic system.
The supergalactic coordinate system is a fundamental plane with a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.
Software.
There is standard software which does the calculations:

= = = Lateral line = = =
The lateral line is a system of sense organs found in fish, and not in land vertebrates. It detects movement and vibration in the surrounding water. Modified epithelial cells, known as hair cells, respond to changes around the fish. These turn the changes into electrical impulses which go to their central nervous system. 
Lateral lines are used in schooling, predation, and orientation. For example, fish use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. They are faint lines running lengthwise down each side, from the gill covers to the base of the tail. 
In some species, the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors, which are organs used to detect electrical impulses. Most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians have systems which work a bit like the lateral line.

= = = Robert I, Duke of Normandy = = =
Robert the Magnificent () (22 June 1000 - 1/3 July 1035), was the sixth Duke of Normandy from 1027 until he died returning from a pilgrimage. Robert's reign was a period in the history of Normandy. He was the father of William the Conqueror, who in 1066 became King of England.
Career.
Robert was the second son of Richard II of Normandy and Judith. He was probably born between 1005 and 1010.
Their father had decided that the older son, Richard III, would succeed him as duke. Robert would became Count of Hiémois. In August 1026 their father, Richard II, died and Richard III became the fifth duke. But once Richard III began to reign, Robert was not satisfied with his position. He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. He also captured his brother's city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised his .
Early reign.
When Richard III died shortly after Robert's surrender, there were suspicions that Robert might have caused his brother's death. Robert was accepted, however, as the sixth duke following his brother. But the Robert I had started against his brother Richard III didn't stop when the two made peace. There were still many feuds which had started between neighboring barons. These continued in Normandy during much of Robert’s reign. It was also during this time that many of the lesser left Normandy to seek their fortunes in southern Italy and elsewhere. Soon after he became duke and possibly in revenge for supporting his brother, Robert I gathered an army and began raiding the lands of his uncle, Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. Only a brief allowed his uncle to leave Normandy in exile. The Archbishop then placed an of on Robert and all of Normandy. The edict was only removed when Archbishop Robert was allowed to return and all his lands were restored. Robert also attacked another powerful church leader, his cousin Hugo d'Ivry, Bishop of Bayeux. Robert banished him from Normandy. Robert also seized a number of church properties belonging to the abbey of Fécamp.
Outside of Normandy.
In spite of all his troubles in Normandy Robert decided to get involved in the civil war in Flanders. This feud was between Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and his father Baldwin IV who the younger Baldwin had driven out of Flanders. Baldwin V, supported by king Robert II of France, his , was persuaded to make peace with his father in 1030. This happened only after Duke Robert promised the elder Baldwin his military support.
Robert gave shelter to Henry I of France against his mother, Queen Constance. The queen wanted her younger son Robert to succeed his father Robert II as king of France. For his help Henry I gave Robert the French Vexin. In the early 1030s Alan III, Duke of Brittany began to expand from the area of Rennes and appeared to have wanted the area around Mont Saint-Michel After raiding Dol and stopping Alan's attempts to raid Avranches, Robert mounted a major campaign against his cousin Alan III. However, Alan appealed to Archbishop Robert of Rouen (they were both his nephews). The Archbishop arranged a peace between Duke Robert and his vassal Alan III.
Robert's cousins, the Athelings Edward and Alfred, had been living in exile at the Norman Court. They were the sons of his aunt Emma of Normandy and Athelred, King of England. At some point Robert attempted an invasion of England on their behalf but was stopped by unfavorable winds. The king of England, Cnut the Great sent envoys to Duke Robert offering to settle half the Kingdom of England on Edward and Alfred. After postponing the invasion he chose to also postpone the decision until after he returned from Jerusalem.
The Church and his pilgrimage.
Robert's attitude towards the Church changed completely since his uncle's return from exile. To make up for what he had done to the Church earlier he restored all the property that he or his vassals had taken. He also decided to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to make up for his sins. After making his illegitimate son William his heir, he set out on his pilgrimage. He travelled by way of Constantinople and reached Jerusalem. He fell seriously ill and died on the return journey at Nicaea on 2 July 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.
According to the historian William of Malmesbury, decades later, Robert's son William sent a mission to Constantinople and Nicaea to return his father's body to Normandy for . Permission was granted, but, having travelled as far as Apulia (Italy) on the return journey, the learned that William himself had died. They then decided to Robert's body in Italy.

History.
Norman conquest of England.
Ponthieu played a small role in the events that led up to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Harold Godwinson of England was blown ashore at Ponthieu in 1064. He was taken captive by the men of Guy I and held for ransom at the castle of Beaurain. Thinking Harold might be useful to him William II, Duke of Normandy, secured his release. William escorted him to Rouen and gave him many gifts. 
william then had Harold take 'many oaths' to support his claim to the English throne and to become William's vassal. But a year after Harold's return to England when king Edward the Confessor died, Harold quickly forgot his oaths and took the crown for himself. That same year Harold was killed at Battle of Hastings and William became King of England.
In 1067 the chaplain of Matilda of Flanders, Guy, Bishop of Amiens, composed Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, a Latin poem on the battle of Hastings.
In 1150 the Count of Ponthieu built a fortress for himself at Crotoy, a strategic point on the mouth of the river Somme.
The Hundred Years' War.
During the Hundred Years' War, Ponthieu a number of times. The English claimed control of it from 1279–1369 and again until 1435. During English control of Ponthieu, Abbeville was used as the capital.
In late August 1346 Edward III of England reached the region of Ponthieu. While he was there rebuilt the fortress at Crotoy. He forced a passage of the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque. The army led by Philip VI of France caught up with him at nearby Crécy-en-Ponthieu, leading to the famous Battle of Crécy.
In 1360, the Treaty of Bretigny between King John II of France and Edward III of England gave control of Ponthieu (along with Gascony and Calais) over to the English, in exchange for Edward relinquishing his claim to the French throne. Edward took the land but still refused to surrender his claim.
In April, 1369 Charles V of France conquered Ponthieu. A month later he declared war on England. As a result, Edward publicly reassumed the title 'King of France' in June.
In 1372 an English army under the leadership of Robert Knolles invaded Ponthieu. They burned the city of Le Crotoy before crossing the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque.
In the Treaty of Arras (1435), Charles VII of France convinced Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to break his alliance with the English. In exchange he gave him Ponthieu. This marked a turning point that led to the end of England's part in the conflict 40 years later.
In 1477 Ponthieu was reconquered by King Louis XI of France.
In World War I between 1 July and 18 November 1916 the Battle of the Somme was fought in Ponthieu. It was one of the most costly battles ever fought with over 1,000,000 men killed or wounded.

= = = Abbeville = = =
Abbeville is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.
Location.
Abbeville is on the Somme River, from its modern mouth in the English Channel. Most of the town is on the east bank of the Somme, as well as on an island. It is at the start of the Abbeville Canal, and is northwest of Amiens. In the medieval period, it was the lowest crossing point on the Somme. Edward III's army crossed nearby shortly before the Battle of Crécy in 1346.
Administration.
Abbeville was the capital of the former province of France of Ponthieu. Today, it is one of the three s of the Somme department.
Etymology.
The Romans occupied it and named it "Abbatis Villa".
Prehistory.
The name Abbeville has been adopted to name a category of paleolithic stone tools. These stone tools are also known as handaxes. Various handaxes were found near Abbeville by Jacques Boucher de Perthes during the 1830s. He was the first to describe the stones in detail. He pointed out in the first publication of its kind, that the stones were chipped deliberately by early man, so as to form a tool. These stone tools which are some of the earliest found in Europe, were chipped on both sides so as to form a sharp edge, were known as 'Abbevillian' handaxes or bifaces, but recently the term 'abevillian' is becoming obsolete as the earlier form of stone tool, not found in Europe, is known as the Oldowan chopper. Some of these are displayed at the museum Boucher-de-Perthes.
A more refined form from a later period of handaxe production was found in the Abbeville/Somme River district. The more refined handaxe became known as the Acheulean industry, named after Saint-Acheul, today a suburb of Amiens. It retained some importance into the Bronze Age.
History.
Abbeville during the ninth century was part of the diocese of Saint-Riquier. It was also an important fortress responsible for the defense of the Somme. Abbeville had a charter granted to it in 1184. Afterwards it was governed by the Counts of Ponthieu. Together with that county, it came into the possession of the Alençon and other French families. Afterwards it came into the possession of the House of Castile. By marriage it passed in 1272 to King Edward I of England. In 1435, by the treaty of Arras, it was to the Duke of Burgundy. In 1477 it was taken control of by King Louis XI of France. Later it was held by two illegitimate branches of the royal family in the 16th and 17th centuries, being in 1696 returned to the crown. In 1514, the town was the place where the marriage of Louis XII of France to Mary Tudor took place. She was the daughter of Henry VII of England. In 1685, it suffered a serious economic when the Edict of Nantes was repealed. The Protestants who were the majority of the skilled labor, left town. The town never fully recovered from the loss of their talents.
Abbeville was fairly important in the 18th century. Van Robais Royal Manufacture (one of the first major factories in France) brought great prosperity to the town. Voltaire, among others, wrote about it.
Abbeville was the birthplace of Rear Admiral Amédée Courbet (1827–85). His victories on land and at sea made him a national hero during the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). Courbet died in June 1885 in the Pescadores Islands. His body was brought back to France and buried in Abbeville on 1 September 1885 after a state funeral. Abbeville's old Haymarket Square (Place du Marché-au-Blé) was renamed Place de l'Amiral Courbet in July 1885. This was shortly after the news of Courbet's death reached France. A statue of Courbet was erected in the middle of the square at the end of the nineteenth century. The statue was damaged in a bombing raid during World War II.
On 12 September 1939 in Abbeville a conference took place. There France and the United Kingdom decided it was too late to send troops to help Poland in its fight against Germany. By this time Poland was already on the verge of defeat. After five years—in September 1944—Abbeville was liberated by the Polish First Armoured Division under General Maczek.
The Blitzkrieg.
In 1940, the Germans with the bulk of their armoured force in Panzer Group von Kleist achieved a breakthrough at Sedan with air support. The Panzer group raced to the coast of the English Channel at Abbeville. This isolated (20 May 1940) the British Expeditionary Force, Belgian Army, and some divisions of the French Army in northern France. The Battle of France was lost by the Allies.
Charles de Gaulle (17–18 May 1940), as a Colonel in this period, launched a in the region of Laon (see the map). He had 80 tanks to destroy the communication of the German armoured troops. His newly formed 4e Division cuirassée reached Montcornet, resulting in the Battle of Montcornet. But, without support, the 4th DCR was forced to retreat. There was another counterattack with the Battle of Abbeville. After Laon (24 May), de Gaulle was promoted to temporary general: "On 28 May (...) the 4th DCR attacked twice to destroy a pocket captured by the enemy south of the Somme near Abbeville. The operation was successful, with over 400 prisoners taken and the entire pocket mopped up except for Abbeville (...) but in the second attack the 4th DCR failed to gain control of the city in the face of superior enemy numbers." WWII was not kind to the buildings of the town as the famous 17th century Gothic Cathedral of St. Vulfran was nearly destroyed.
Economy.
Abbeville manufactures ; in particular, linens and tablecloths. It also has factories and spinning mills. Finally, it also makes locks and produces sugar.

Activities.
The "Geographical Names Act, 1966", gives the Board the right to name places, and to find out and decide on the form, spelling, meaning, pronunciation, origin and history of any geographical name. It also decides where and how the name can be used.
A place is any geographical or topographical feature or any district, division, locality, region, city, town, village, settlement or railway station or any other place within the territories and waters of the State of New South Wales. It does not include roads, any local government areas, urban areas, counties or districts under the Local Government Act, electoral districts, subdivisions, or schools. 
The Board has the power to keep and promote Aboriginal languages and acknowledge Aboriginal culture through place naming in NSW. The Board does this by using traditional Aboriginal place names or names with Aboriginal origin wherever it can. The Board can give traditional Aboriginal names to features that have been given introduced names through its dual naming policy.
The Board's policy is the same as the U.S. Board of Geographical Names, which removes possessive names from all place names in NSW. Roads called Smith's Road are changed to Smiths Road or Smith Road.

An electrical insulator is a material that does not easily allow flow of electricity through an electric current. Materials typically used to insulate include rubber, plastic and glass. In transformers and electric motors, varnish is used. Insulating gases such as Sulfur hexafluoride are used in some switches. Wires that carry electric currents are usually insulated so the electricity goes to the right place.
Insulator can mean not only the material but things that are made of that material. They are made of various materials such as: glass, silicone, rubber, plastic, oil, wood, dry cotton, quartz, ceramic, etc. 
The type of insulator will depend on the uses. Insulators have high electrical resistivity and low conductivity. The insulators prevent the loss of current and make the current more efficient by concentrating the flow. 
Insulator devices.
Electric power transmission uses three types of overhead insulator: pin insulator, suspension insulator, and strain insulator.

= = = Charles the Simple = = =
Charles III (17 September 879 – 7 October 929), called the Simple or the Straightforward (from the Latin "Carolus Simplex"), was the King of the Franks from 898 until 922 and the King of Lotharingia from 911 until 919–23. He was a member of the Carolingian dynasty.
Early life.
Charles was the third and posthumous son of Louis the Stammerer by his second wife, Adelaide of Paris. As a child, Charles was not allowed to become king in 884 when his half-brother Carloman died. The Frankish nobles instead asked his cousin, Charles the Fat, to rule over them. King Charles the Fat was not a good king so he was removed (deposed) in November 887. He died soon after in January 888. The nobility elected Odo, the hero of the Siege of Paris as their king. Charles Simplex was put under the protection of Ranulf II of Aquitaine who used the royal title himself until making peace with Odo.
King of Western Francia.
In 893 Charles was finally crowned by part of the nobility who were opposed to Odo. He was crowned at Reims Cathedral but was not fully accepted as king until Odo died in 898.
In 911, a group of Vikings lead by Rollo besieged Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to negotiate with Rollo. The talks were led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims. This resulted in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, which granted Rollo and his soldiers all the land between the river Epte and the sea. It also granted him Brittany, "for his livelihood". At the time, Brittany was an independent land which France had not been able to conquer. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty and military assistance when needed. Also Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Gisela, the king's daughter. The territory given Rollo is about the same as Upper Normandy. This would grow to become Normandy under Rollo's descendants. 
Also in 911, Louis the Child, the King of Germany, died. The nobles of Lotharingia made Charles their new king even though some had elected Conrad of Franconia king. Charles had tried to win their support for years. In April 907 he married a Lotharingian noblewoman named Frederuna. He also defended Lotharingia twice against attacks by Conrad, King of the Germans. Queen Frederuna died on 10 February 917 leaving six daughters and no sons. so Charles did not have an heir. On 7 October 919 Charles married again to Eadgifu of Wessex (England). She was the daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England. She bore him his only son, the future King Louis IV of France. 
Charles' had a favorite at court, a man named Hagano. This turned his nobles against Charles. He gave Hagano several monasteries that already belonged to other barons which angered them. Charles also turned the new duke, Gilbert against him. He turned his support to the German king Henry the Fowler in 919. Not everyone in Lotharingia was against Charles; he kept the support of Wigeric.
Revolt of the nobles.
Finally the nobles seized Charles in 920. They were tired of Charles' policies and his favoritism of count Hagano. 
But after negotiations by Archbishop Herveus of Reims the king was released.
In 922 the Frankish nobles revolted again led by Robert of Neustria. Robert was Odo's brother and was elected king by the rebels. Charles had to flee to Lotharingia. On 2 July 922, Charles lost his most faithful supporter, Herveus of Reims. Charles returned with a Norman army in 923 but was defeated on 15 June near Soissons by Robert, who died in the battle. Charles was captured and in a castle at Péronne under the guard of Herbert II of Vermandois. Charles' English wife Eadgifu and their son Louis fled to England. Robert's Rudolph of Burgundy was elected to succeed him. In 925 the Lotharingia became part of the Kingdom of Germany. Charles died in prison on 7 October 929 and was buried at the nearby abbey of Saint-Fursy. His only son by Eadgifu would later be crowned in 936 as Louis IV of France.
Family.
Charles married first, in May 907, Frederuna, daughter of Dietrich, Count in the Hamaland. Together they had six daughters:
In 919 Charles married secondly Eadgifu of Wessex. Together they had:

= = = Robert Curthose = = =
Robert Curthose (–1134), sometimes styled Robert II or Robert III, was the Duke of Normandy from 1087 until 1106. He was also Count of Maine. His reign as Duke is noted for the conflicts he had with his brothers in England. This led to the dukedom of Normandy being reunited with crown of England.
Early career.
Robert was the eldest son of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, and Matilda of Flanders. Robert was born . As a child he was to Margaret, the heiress of Maine. But she died before they could be wed. Robert didn't marry until he was in his late forties.
Robert was brought up among William's . As a result, he became a skilled warrior. But unlike his father he expected to live a life of pleasure and luxury. In 1063, his father made him the count of Maine when he was contracted to marry Margaret. But Robert had no authority. The county was actually run by his father until 1069 when the county revolted and reverted to Hugh V of Maine. Still, he had been made his father's heir. Twice the barons had taken an oath of fealty to him as their future leader.
In 1077 Robert got into an argument with his father. He demanded to rule Normandy which he had on at least on occasion while William was in England. William was not able to reason with his son and Robert left angry. The next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize Rouen. The siege failed. After rebelling against his father all he could do was go into exile. 
Robert first went to Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. He then fled to Flanders to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders. 
In the spring of 1080 Robert was back on good terms with his father. He again made Robert his heir for Normandy in the presences of his barons. Later that summer or early fall Robert went with his father to England. William placed Robert in charge of a large army to march north and deal with King Malcolm III of Scotland. Malcolm had been raiding the north of England while William was occupied in Normandy. When the two armies drew near each other, Malcolm did not want to fight. He again swore fealty to king William and gave hostages. Robert remained in England with his father until the end of 1081. Events in Maine caused William and Robert to return to Normandy. Fulk IV, Count of Anjou had been attacking in Maine again trying to get control away from Normandy. William and Robert led a great army into Maine to confront the Angevin count. Before the fighting could start, a cardinal and several monks stopped the battle. They called for a truce and after much negotiation one was agreed to. The count of Anjou was to let Normandy have Maine, but Robert, as count of Maine, had to recognize Fulk IV as his overlord for Maine. When Queen Matilda died in 1083 Robert seemed to abandon his father. He and his mother had been very close. 
In 1087, the Conqueror died of wounds suffered from a riding accident during a siege of Mantes. At his death he reportedly wanted to disinherit his eldest son but was persuaded to divide the Norman dominions between his two eldest sons. To Robert he granted the Duchy of Normandy and to William Rufus he granted the Kingdom of England. The youngest son Henry was given money to buy land. Of the two elder sons Robert was considered to be much the weaker and was generally preferred by the nobles who held lands on both sides of the English Channel since they could more easily circumvent his authority. At the time of their father's death the two brothers made an agreement to be each other's heir. However this peace lasted less than a year when barons joined with Robert to displace Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. It was not a success, in part because Robert never showed up to support the English rebels.
Robert took as his close adviser Ranulf Flambard, who had been previously a close adviser to his father. Flambard later became an astute but much-disliked financial adviser to William Rufus until the latter's death in 1100.
In 1096, Robert left for the Holy Land on the First Crusade. At the time of his departure he was reportedly so poor that he often had to stay in bed for lack of clothes. In order to raise money for the crusade he mortgaged his duchy to his brother William for the sum of 10,000 marks.
When William II died on 2 August 1100, Robert was on his return journey from the Crusade and was about to marry a wealthy young bride to raise funds to buy back his duchy. As a result, his brother Henry was able to seize the crown of England for himself. Upon his return, Robert – urged by Flambard and several Anglo-Norman barons – claimed the English crown on the basis of the short-lived agreement of 1087. In 1101, he led an invasion to oust his brother Henry; he landed at Portsmouth with his army but his lack of popular support among the English as well as Robert's own mishandling of the invasion tactics enabled Henry to resist the invasion. Robert was forced by diplomacy to renounce his claim to the English throne in the Treaty of Alton. It is said that Robert was a brilliant field commander but a terrible general in the First Crusade. His government (or misgovernment) of Normandy as well as his failed invasion of England suggests that his military skills were little better than his political skills.
In 1105, however, Robert's continual stirring of discord with his brother in England as well as civil disorder in Normandy itself prompted Henry to invade Normandy. Orderic reports on an incident at Easter 1105 when Robert was supposed to hear a sermon by the venerable Serlo, Bishop of Sées. Robert spent the night before sporting with harlots and jesters and while he lay in bed sleeping off his drunkenness his unworthy friends stole his clothes. He awoke to find himself naked and had to remain in bed and missed the sermon.
In 1106, Henry defeated Robert's army decisively at the Battle of Tinchebray and claimed Normandy as a possession of the English crown, a situation that endured for almost a century. Captured after the battle, Robert was imprisoned in Devizes Castle for twenty years before being moved to Cardiff.
In 1134, Robert died in Cardiff Castle in his early eighties. Robert Curthose, sometime Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the Conqueror, was buried in the abbey church of St. Peter in Gloucester. The exact place of his burial is difficult to establish – legend states that he requested to be buried before the High Altar. His effigy carved in bog oak, however, lies on a mortuary chest decorated with the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies (missing one – Joshua, and replaced with the arms of Edward the Confessor). The effigy dates from about 100 years after his death and the mortuary chest much later. The church subsequently has become Gloucester Cathedral.
Family.
Robert married Sybilla of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Brindisi, Count of Conversano (and a grandniece of Robert Guiscard, another Norman duke) on the way back from Crusade, one child:
Robert also had at least three illegitimate children:

October is the second album by Irish rock band U2. It was released on 12 October 1981. The album is about spirituality. It got mixed reviews and it was not played much by radio stations.
Recording.
After touring for Boy, U2 began to write new songs. The band started recording in the studio in July 1981. Then Bono lost his notebook with the lyrics after a show in Portland, Oregon. He had to make up the words to songs as he was singing on the microphone. His lost notebook was returned many years later, in 2004. Bono said its return was "an act of grace".
Reception.
When it was released, "October" got more mixed reviews than their first album, "Boy".
Dave McCullough of "Sounds" magazine praised the album. He said: "A kind of zenith pop then, no half measures. It all breathes fire... 'Gloria' being possibly Their Finest Moment and 'Tomorrow', low and muted, gently oozing emotion". McCullough also said, "This "October" will last forever".
Adam Sweeting of "Melody Maker" also gave a good review. He said: "Their whole musical sensibility is shaped by a strong emotional bond to their homeland and its traditions. It gives them a completely different frame of reference from most groups...
But, "NME" gave a negative review. Barney Hoskyns talked about the "excessive plaintiveness of Bono's voice and the forced power of U2's sound". He also said: "Obviously rock doesn't expire just because groups run out of ways to change it... U2, I guess, will continue to 'move' in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does 'soar'... But then 'God' knows, there are other religions".

All of the songs were written by U2, and all of the lyrics were written by Bono.

Background.
The Union Army of the Tennessee was commanded by Ulysses S. Grant. Grant had captured Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in western Tennessee during the early months of 1862. This forced the Confederate Army to leave Kentucky, western Tennessee, and central Tennessee.
Grant wanted to capture the city of Corinth, Mississippi, next. But his superior, Henry W. Halleck, didn't want Grant to go any further south until other Union soldiers joined him. So Grant moved his army to a place called Pittsburg Landing, which was on the Tennessee River. There was a church near the landing called Shiloh Church. His army stayed there for several weeks.
General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded the Confederates. Johnston's second-in-command was P. G. T. Beauregard. Beauregard came up with a plan to recapture western Tennessee. Confederate soldiers from all over the Western theater gathered in Corinth. Then, starting on April 3rd, they marched north toward Grant's army. The Confederate Army was ready to attack on the morning of the 6th.
The Battle.
The battle started around dawn on April 6th. The Confederates surprised the Union Army. After fighting all day, Grant's army retreated back to Pittsburg Landing. Johnston was killed during the battle, and Beauregard took over the Confederate Army.
More Union soldiers arrived at the battlefield during the night. They were part of the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Don Carlos Buell.
Grant attacked the Confederates the next morning. The two armies fought all morning and during the afternoon. By 4 p.m., Beauregard decided to retreat back to Corinth.
Aftermath.
The Confederates lost 10,698 casualties during the battle. Union soldiers buried the Confederate dead on the battlefield. The Union Army lost about 14,500 casualties during the battle.

Russian human rights activist and dissident Lyudmila Alexeyeva explained glasnost as a word that "had been in the Russian language for centuries. It was in the dictionaries and lawbooks as long as there had been dictionaries and lawbooks. It was an ordinary, hardworking, nondescript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice of governance, being conducted in the open".
Glasnost can also refer to the specific period in the history of the USSR during the 1980s when there was less censorship and greater freedom of information.

= = = Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte = = =
The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte was signed in the autumn of 911. It was a treaty between Charles the Simple and Rollo, one of the leaders of the Vikings living in Neustria. It was to protect Charles' kingdom from any new invasion by the "Northmen. In 911, a group of Vikings lead by Rollo Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to try to reach an agreement with Rollo. The talks were led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims. The result was the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. The treaty granted Rollo all land between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for his fealty. In addition, the treaty granted Rollo Brittany "for his ". At the time, Brittany was an independent region which France had not been able to control. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty, which involved military assistance for the protection of the kingdom. As a token of his good will, Rollo also agreed to be baptised and marry Gisela a daughter of king Charles.
The territory covered by the treaty is nearly the same as today’s Upper Normandy down to the Seine river. It would later extend west beyond the Seine to form the Duchy of Normandy, named for the northmen who ruled it. The treaty was entered into after the death of Alan I, King of Brittany and at the time another group of Vikings occupied Brittany. Around 937 Alan I's son, Alan II returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany. This happened in 939. During this period the Cotentin Peninsula was lost by Brittany and gained by Normandy. 

= = = Epte = = =
The Epte is a river in Seine-Maritime and Eure, in Normandy, France. It is a tributary of the river Seine. It begins in Seine-Maritime department in the Pays de Bray, near Forges-les-Eaux. The river empties into the Seine not far from Giverny.
In 911 the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte established the river as the historical boundary between Normandy and Île-de-France. This divided the traditional county of the Vexin into two parts. The Norman Vexin became a part of Normandy while the French Vexin remained a part of the Île-de-France. A series of castles were built on both banks of the Epte to guard this frontier. 
Claude Monet lived at Giverny near the river for more than forty years. In his garden, by diverting a branch of the Epte, he established a water garden with its famous water-lily pond and a Japanese-style bridge. The river appears in several of his works, including "Peupliers au bord de l'Epte" (Poplars on the Banks of the Epte).

In Pocket Gamer, Harry Slater, a player of this game, prefers "Angry Birds" to "Amazing Alex". He said, "That's not to say that Amazing Alex isn't an addictive experience - it's just that compared to Angry Birds, there's less excitement involved. You rarely feel like throwing your arms in the air when you've completed a puzzle, for example, and the absence of any kind of antagonist reduces the stakes slightly."

= = = William Clito = = =
William "Clito" (1102–1128), was the Count of Flanders and Duke of Normandy. His "Clito" was a Latin term meaning the same as the Anglo-Saxon "". Both "Clito" and "Atheling" signified a "man of royal blood", or the modern term "prince".
History and family.
Youth.
William was the son of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, and his wife Sybilla of Conversano. She was the daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano (in southern Italy). His father, the Duke of Normandy was defeated and captured by his brother Henry I of England at the Battle of Tinchebrai in (1106). Robert Curthose went with Henry I to Falaise where Henry met his nephew the young William Clito for the first time. Henry placed his nephew in the custody of Helias of Saint Saens, Count of Arques. Helias had married a daughter of Duke Robert, his friend and lord. The boy William stayed under the care of Helias until August 1110. At that time the king suddenly sent agents to demand the boy be handed over to him. At the time Helias was away from home. But his servants hid the boy and smuggled him to their master. Helias fled to safety among Henry's enemies.
First Norman Rebellion, 1118–19.
William’s first refuge was with King Henry’s great enemy, Robert de Bellême, who had extensive lands south of Normandy. When Robert of Bellême was captured in 1112, William and Helias fled to the court of the young Count Baldwin VII of Flanders who was another of William’s cousins. In 1118 a number of Norman counts and barons were tired enough of King Henry to ally with Count Baldwin. They took up William Clito’s cause and started a dangerous rebellion.
The Norman border counts and Count Baldwin were too powerful for the king to fight. They seized much of the north part of Normandy. But the campaign quickly ended when count Baldwin was injured at the siege of Arques (September 1118). The next year the cause of William Clito was taken up by Louis VI of France. He invaded Normandy down the river Seine. On 20 August 1119 the French king was met by the troops of King Henry at the Battle of Brémule. Louis and his army were defeated. 
William Clito was riding as a knight with the French king’s guard that day. He narrowly escaped capture when the French lost the battle. The next day his cousin, King Henry’s son, William Adelin, sent him back the horse he had lost in the battle with other "necessities" as a matter of chivalry. The rebellion collapsed, but the French king continued to support him. Louis brought his case to the pope’s attention in October 1119 at Reims, and forced Henry I to give reasons for his harsh treatment of the exiled boy.
Second Norman Rebellion, 1123–24.
On 25 November 1120 tragedy struck Henry I of England. His son, William Adelin was among the nobles who drowned when the White ship sunk in the English Channel. The loss of King Henry’s only legitimate son, changed William Clito’s fortunes. He was now the obvious male heir to England and Normandy. A significant party of Norman nobles took up his cause. Henry's problems became worse. His his son William Adelin had been promised in marriage to Matilda of Anjou, the daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou. Fulk now wanted her dowry, including several castles and towns in Maine, returned. But Henry flatly refused. Fulk then promised his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, giving him the county of Maine as her dowry. King Henry then appealed to canon (Church) law and the marriage was eventually (not legal) in August 1124. The William and Sibylla were too closely related under Church laws of the time to be married.
In the meantime, a serious rebellion broke out in Normandy in favour of William Clito. But this was defeated by Henry’s spy network. There was also very little organization among the leaders. They were defeated at the battle of Bourgtheroulde in March 1124. Henry I also got his son-in-law, the Emperor Henry V, to threaten Louis from the east. This kept king Louis VI distracted so he could not offer help.
Count of Flanders.
In 1127, Louis VI was able to make great efforts to help William’s cause. In January he gave him the royal lands in the French Vexin as a base to attack down the Seine into Normandy. Also he married the French queen’s Joanna of Montferrat. The murder of Count Charles the Good of Flanders on 2 March 1127 gave King Louis a good chance to further William’s fortunes. The king marched into Flanders at the head of an army and on 30 March got the barons of the province to accept William as their new count.
William started out very well as count. By the end of May he had most of the county cooperating with him. But English money and a new rival, Thierry of Alsace, led to a weakening of his position. In February 1128 Saint-Omer and Ghent said they would no longer accept him as their count. Bruges did the same in March. In May 1128 Lille too welcomed Thierry. This left William controlling little more than the southern fringe of Flanders. However, he struck back at Bruges. In the battle of Axspoele south of the town on 21 June, William with his Norman knights and French allies defeated Thierry. 
At this point William was joined by his , Duke Godfrey of Brabant. Together their armies besieged Aalst on 12 July. But during the course of the siege William was wounded in the arm in a scuffle with a foot soldier. The wound became and William died at the age of twenty-five on 28 July 1128. His faithful , Helias of Saint Saens, was there with him. William’s body was carried to the abbey of St Bertin in St Omer and buried there. He left no children and was survived by his father, a prisoner of Henry I, who died six years later.

= = = Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou = = =
Geoffrey V (1113–1151), called the Handsome () and Plantagenet (), was the Count of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine from 1129. He was the Duke of Normandy from 1144. By his marriage to the Empress Matilda, daughter and heiress of Henry I of England, Geoffrey had a son, Henry Curtmantle, who succeeded to the English throne. Geoffrey was the founder of the House of Plantagenet, so named for his nickname.
Early career.
Geoffrey was the elder son of Fulk V, King of Jerusalem and his wife Ermengarde of Maine. She was the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Geoffrey, born 24 August 1113, was named after his great-grandfather Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais. He received his nickname, Plantagenet, from the yellow sprig of broom blossom ("genêt" is the French name for the "planta genista", or broom shrub) he wore in his hat. King Henry I of England sent his royal to Anjou to arrange a marriage between Geoffrey and his daughter, Matilda. Consent was given by both parties. On 10 June 1128 King Henry I knighted the fifteen-year-old Geoffrey.
Marriage.
In 1128 Geoffrey married Empress Matilda, the daughter and heiress of King Henry I of England and widow of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage was meant to seal a peace between England/Normandy and Anjou. She was about eleven years older than Geoffrey, and very proud of her status as an Empress (as opposed to being a mere Countess). Their marriage was a stormy one with frequent long separations, but she bore him three sons and survived him.
Count of Anjou.
The year after the marriage Geoffrey's father left for Jerusalem to marry the heiress of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Geoffrey became the sole count of Anjou. When King Henry I died in 1135, Matilda at once entered Normandy to claim her inheritance. The border districts submitted to her, but England chose her cousin Stephen of Blois for its king, and Normandy soon followed suit. The following year, Geoffrey gave Ambrieres, Gorron, and Chatilon-sur-Colmont to Juhel de Mayenne, on condition that he help obtain the inheritance of Geoffrey's wife. In 1139 Matilda landed in England with 140 knights, where she was besieged at Arundel Castle by King Stephen. In the "Anarchy" which ensued, Stephen was captured at Lincoln in February, 1141, and imprisoned at Bristol. A legatine council of the English church held at Winchester in April 1141 declared Stephen deposed and proclaimed Matilda "Lady of the English". Stephen was subsequently released from prison and had himself recrowned on the anniversary of his first coronation.
During 1142 and 1143, Geoffrey secured all of Normandy west and south of the Seine, and, on 14 January 1144, he crossed the Seine and entered Rouen. He assumed the title of Duke of Normandy in the summer of 1144. In 1144, he founded an Augustine priory at Chateau-l'Ermitage in Anjou. Geoffrey held the duchy until 1149, when he and Matilda conjointly ceded it to their son, Henry, which cession was formally ratified by King Louis VII of France the following year.
Geoffrey also put down three baronial rebellions in Anjou, in 1129, 1135, and 1145–1151. He was often at odds with his younger brother, Elias, whom he had imprisoned until 1151. The threat of rebellion slowed his progress in Normandy, and is one reason he could not intervene in England. In 1153, the Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen should remain King of England for life and that Henry, the son of Geoffrey and Matilda should succeed him.
Death.
Geoffrey died suddenly on 7 September 1151. According to John of Marmoutier, Geoffrey was returning from a royal council when he was stricken with fever. He arrived at Château-du-Loir, collapsed on a couch, made bequests of gifts and charities, and died. He was buried at St. Julien's Cathedral in Le Mans France.
Children.
Geoffrey and Matilda's children were:
Geoffrey also had illegitimate children by an unknown mistress (or mistresses): Hamelin; Emme, who married Dafydd Ab Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales; and Mary, who became a nun and Abbess of Shaftesbury and who may be the poetess Marie de France. Adelaide of Angers is sometimes sourced as being the mother of Hamelin.

= = = Ammonis cornua = = =
Ammonis is a dubious genus of extinct ammonite known from fossils found near Pompeii in Ancient Rome. The only known species, Ammonis cornua, was named by Pliny the Elder in A.D. 79. Its fossils were found in the same Pompeiian aged rocks as which "Scipionyx" was discovered in, which were about 110 million years old.
The name "Ammonis cornua", from which the scientific term is derived, was inspired by the spiral shape of their fossilized shells, which somewhat resemble tightly coiled rams' horns. Pliny the Elder (d. 79 AD near Pompeii) called fossils of these animals "ammonis cornua" ("horns of Ammon") because the Egyptian god Ammon (Amun) was typically depicted wearing ram's horns. Often the name of an ammonite genus ends in -"ceras", which is Greek (�����) for "horn".
All known specimens of "Ammonis cornua" were destroyed in A.D. 79 when Mount Vesuvius destroyed Pompeii.

His father, Hans Klee, came from Tann, a small town in the Hesse state of Germany. Both his parents were musicians. When he was very young he trained to be a violinist. Then he decided to become an artist. He studied art under Heinrich Knirr. In 1899 he was admitted to the Academy of Fine arts in Munich. After leaving the academy he also studied art in Italy. After Italy, he returned to Bern and lived with his parents for several years.
Klee married the pianist Lily Stumpf in 1906. They went to live in Munich. In 1906 he had his first major exhibition. Besides his painting, Klee taught art at the Bauhaus from 1920 to 1931. and later at the Dusseldorf Academy. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, life became very hard for modern artists. Klee moved back to Switzerland in 1933. He died in Muralto, Switzerland in 1940. For many years he had suffered from scleroderma, an autoimmune disease.
Klee made over 10,000 paintings, drawings, and etchings in his lifetime. His works are held in museums all over the world. In 2005, the Zentrum Paul Klee (Paul Klee Center) was opened in Bern. The building was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. It holds 4000 works by Klee and shows 150 at time. The exhibition changes every six months.

These pictures are from Klee's mature career. He painted them while he was teaching at the Bauhaus. During this time he was also a member of a group of artists called Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four). The other three members were Wassily Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky. Like Klee, both Kandinsky and Feininger taught at the Bauhaus. The four artists lectured and exhibited together in Germany and the USA. 

= = = Indohyus = = =
Indohyus (meaning "India's pig") is a small deer-like creature, which lived about 49 or 48 million years ago in Kashmir, India. It belongs to the artiodactyls family "Raoellidae", and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea. It lived during the same time as the related "Pakicetus". The two may have coexisted.
About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this herbivorous creature shared some of the traits of whales. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer bone coating. This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, and reduces buoyancy so that they can stay underwater. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.
There are two known species of Indohyus:

= = = Himalayacetus = = =
Himalayacetus is an extinct aquatic cetacean known from fossils found in the Himachal Pradesh, India. It lived in the remnants of the ancient Tethys Ocean during the early Eocene. This extends the fossil record of whales by some 3.5 million years.
"Himalayacetus" lived in the coastline of the ancient Tethys Ocean before the Indian plate collided with Eurasia. It is only known from a single jaw fossil, which makes exact comparisons with other cetaceans almost impossible.

= = = Inferno (Dante) = = =
Inferno by the Italian author Dante, is a work of fiction made in the 1500s, as a part of The Divine Comedy. It tells of the fictional journey that two men, Dante himself as well as Greek poet Virgil, takes place through Christian Hell. Hell is made up of several levels, or circles, in which sinners are divided and punished according to their sins. Their punishments are measured according to how many good deeds vs bad deeds were done.
The Divine Comedy describes the journey of the soul toward God. And Inferno is about the recognition and rejection of sin. 

= = = Qubit = = =
A Qubit (or QBit) is a unit of measure used in quantum computing. 
Like a bit in normal (non-quantum) computing, a Qubit has two distinct states, 0 state and the 1 state. However, unlike the normal bit, a qubit can have a state that is somewhere in-between, called a "superposition."
You cannot measure the superposition without the superposition going away (changing). If you try to measure a qubit that is in a superposition, the qubit will change, and become one of two states. The resulting state the qubit changes to depends on how it is measured. For simplicity, let's assume we are measuring in a way that will make the qubit change to either a 0 state or a 1 state.
A qubit can be represented as a 2-element column vector.
A qubit in the 0 state looks like formula_1. 
A qubit in the 1 state looks like formula_2.
In general, a qubit state will look like formula_3 , where formula_4.
� and � are called amplitudes. They can be complex numbers. Each state has an amplitude.
By squaring a state's amplitude, you can get the probability of measuring that state.
Each state can also have a phase. The phase is part of the amplitude and is what can make the amplitude a complex number.
A state's phase is like how much that state has rotated. The angle of phase is usually represented as either � or �. Let's use �.
� can go from 0 to formula_5 radians. The angle sort of goes into an Euler identity, where instead of formula_6, the formula_7 gets substituted with the angle �. The state's phase becomes formula_8.
This expression formula_8is a phase factor that becomes part of a state's amplitude. It gets multiplied with the amplitude.
A phase angle of 0 makes the amplitudes positive real numbers, since formula_10.
A phase angle of formula_11 makes the amplitudes negative real numbers, since formula_12. (This is Euler's identity)
A phase angle of formula_13 makes the amplitudes positive imaginary numbers, since formula_14.
A phase angle of formula_15 makes the amplitudes negative imaginary numbers, since formula_16.
Beyond 0 and formula_5, the phase angle just wraps back around again, since it is just a rotation.
An example qubit may look like formula_18. There is a 50% chance of measuring a 0 or a 1. There is a phase of 1 on the 0 state's amplitude. There is a phase of -1 on the 1 state's amplitude.
Qubits are generally written as kets, which look like formula_19. Kets are part of Bra-Ket notation, also known as Dirac notation. Kets are a way of saying column vector.
The 0 and 1 state are written as formula_20 and formula_21 respectively. 
A general qubit in ket notation will be written as formula_22.
This equation is exactly the same as formula_23, since formula_24

= = = Austin serial bombings = = =
The Austin serial bombings were a series of five parcel bomb explosions which occurred from March 2 - 20, 2018 in Austin, Texas, United States. They killed two civilians and the bomber, as well as injuring another six people.
The suspected bomber was Mark Anthony Conditt, age 23, who lived in Pflugerville, Texas, outside Austin.
Background.
The Austin Police Department (APD) believe the explosions were connected and considered the possibility that they are racially motivated. They have also warned civilians to not open suspicious packages, and to call the police.
Austin police officially connected the March 2 bombing following the bombings on March 12. None of the packages were mailed, instead they were placed near the individuals' homes. Two of the bombs were triggered upon being picked up, another was triggered upon being opened, and the fourth bombing was suspected to be activated by tripwire.
On March 2, 2018, 39-year-old Anthony Stephan House was killed by picking up an apparent package bomb at his home. Then, on March 13, 2018, the bombings killed 17-year-old cellist Draylen Mason. 
Authorities first offered a reward of $65,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the bomber or bombers. They later raised the reward to $115,000.
Reaction.
On March 20, 2018, President Donald Trump said at the White House: "This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals...These are sick people, and we have to find them as soon as possible". 
Death of the bomber.
Early on March 21, Mark Anthony Conditt was identified by investigators via security footage taken at a FedEx store, and police moved in to make an arrest. As SWAT officers approached, he detonated a bomb in the vehicle, killing himself and injuring one of them, prompting other officers to fire upon the vehicle.

= = = Alexej von Jawlensky = = =
Alexej von Jawlensky (13 March, 1864 – 15 March 1941) was a Russian painter. He first studied art in Russia but he spent most of his career in Germany. He painted in the Expressionist style and was particularly known for his portraits. He also painted landscapes and still lifes.
Life and career.
Jawlensky was born in Torzhok, a town in the western part of Russia. His father, Georgi von Jawlensky, was a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. Like his four brothers, Jawlenskywas became an officer in the army. He studied at the military academy in Moscow, but was very interested in art. He studied art privately while he was serving as a soldier. In 1890 he was accepted at the St. Petersburg Academy of Art. He received permission from the army to study art there while still serving as a soldier. He became friends with artists who worked in the studio of Ilya Repin.
In 1896, Jawlensky resigned from the army. He went to Munich in Germany to study art and begin his career as a painter. In Munich he lived with Marianne von Werefkin. She was a painter who studied with Repin. He studied with Anton Ažbe in Munich. He also became friends with Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky became an important influence on Jawlensky's art. In 1902 Jawlensky's son Andreas was born. His mother was Hélène Nesnakomoff (1881-1965). She was Marianne von Werefkin's maid in Russia and then lived with her and Jawlensky in Munich. In 1905–1906 Jawlensky travelled to Paris for an exhibition of his paintings. In Paris he met Henri Matisse. Matisse became another important influence on Jawlensky's painting style. World War I began in 1914. Jawlensky was expelled from Germany because Russia was one of the countries fighting against Germany. He went to live in Switzerland.
In 1922 Jawlensky married Hélène Nesnakomoff. They returned to Germany and settled in Wiesbaden. For the next 11 years, he concentrated on abstract paintings of heads. He also organized the artistic group "Die Blaue Vier" (The Blue Four). The other three members of the group were Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Paul Klee. The four artists lectured and exhibited together in Germany and the USA. From 1929 Jawlensky suffered very badly from arthritis. He had to give up painting in 1937 because he could no longer hold his brushes. He died in Weisbaden in 1941 at the age of 77.
Jawlensky's son Andreas (1902-1984) also became a painter. As a teenager he exhibited with his father. By the end of the 1920s, he became known in his own right. Andreas served in the German army during World War II. He was captured by the Russians and spent 10 years in prisoner of war camp in Siberia. His later paintings, done in Germany and Switzerland, were mostly landscapes. In 1987 there was an exhibition of both Alezej and Andreas's paintings in New York City.
Gallery.
The first picture is a portrait of Jawlensky's future wife, Hélène Nesnakomoff from 1900. It was painted in the more realistic style taught in the art schools of Russia. The later paintings show the influence of expressionism and fauvism on Jawlensky's work after he moved to Germany.

= = = Sustainability in Conwy = = =
The local authority of Conwy is located in North Wales and borders Gwynedd and Denbighshire. The County includes some of North Wales’s largest settlements such as Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Conwy town. It has holds 4% of Wales’s total population at 111,273 for mid-2006 according to the national assembly for Wales (2006). Industry in this county has changed considerably over the last 2 centuries as during the industrial revolution slate quarrying was a big industry as stated by Day (2002, PP36) “The most distinctive economic feature of north-west Wales was its unique slate quarrying industry”. However, in recent times there has been a big emphasis on tourism, especially in seaside resorts such as Llandudno. But one big questioned raised by many in recent years is how is sustainability being implemented in Conwy? This article will focus on sustainable approaches in which Conwy as a local authority are implementing over the next couple of years. This report assesses the sustainability of Conwy in regards to environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations in this region but also looking at Conwy’s LDP and corporate plan for 2017-2022.
Environmental Sustainability.
Conwy being located on the North Wales Coast and stretching into the Snowdonia National Park has very impressive and outstanding scenery. Although as mentioned earlier slate quarrying in some of these areas has left scaring on the landscape with “entire mountains chiseled away” Day (2002, PP36) in some areas. It is therefore crucial that Conwy is enlisting schemes to help preserve its environment for future generations. In 2016 the Welsh assembly government published the Environment for Wales act (2016). This act applies to all the public bodies in wales and aims to help Welsh local authorities by up to 80% by 2050 - Conwy Council (2017) and this features in both the corporate plan and the LDP for Conwy.  
They plan to do this by a number of objectives including implementing sustainable coastal and flooding defenses so properties and the coastline at risk are protected by a scheme, which is fit for purpose. Also the CBCC (2017) is aiming to improve recycling facilities and working with the Welsh government to increase recycling and reduce their Carbon footprint by investing in more renewable energies. In regards to renewable energy in this county they are trying to promote the development of a tidal lagoon in Colwyn Bay. This project would not only produce renewable low carbon energy for North Wales but can act as a coastal defense on the Conwy coastline and has potential to be used as a recreational facility. The County are also looking into other renewable energy schemes for the future decades. Leading on from this the CBCC (2017) state in there LDP that they are focusing on improving the landscape of areas that have been scared because of quarrying as mentioned earlier. This is in conjunction with the environment for Wales act (2016) and mentions that they are introducing agricultural grading to their land to ensure it returns its essential nutrients and increasing peat productions. Another scheme which is CBCC are looking to implement is a green wedge scheme. This involves promoting and encouraging the amount of green space available in the county and this is incorporated in both their LDP and corporate plan. 
Cultural sustainability.
Cultural sustainability is the adapting beneficial parts of a specific nation’s history and culture to help the development for the future and present generations. Aspects such as language and historical buildings reflect tradition values of past cultures and can therefore be used as a means to measure sustainability. In the 2011 census published by the Conwy County Borough Council, that in Conwy: 
Studies in China show that among those living in China there was strong evidence of residents having a specific connection to building that represent their history and past culture. Even though this is a study that was conducted in China, examples of this can also be seen everywhere in the world including Conwy. This sense of longing for historical styled building is evident in Wales in terms of listed buildings. 
In Wales (and England) buildings with significant historical interest are often classified into either Grade I or Grade II buildings. Grade I listed buildings are buildings with significant historic relevance whereas Grade II listed buildings are buildings which are important in reflection to past history and culture but with less significance than Grade I buildings. Accorded to the British Listed Building website Conwy has a total of 254 listed buildings (both Grade I and Grade II), which is the second highest in the whole of Wales, second to Llandudno which has 394 and then followed by Abergele which has 81. The listed buildings in Conwy range from Grade I listed buildings such as: 
Grade II buildings such as:
Buildings can also be used to view the national identity of the area through the eyes of those living there and those visiting as in recent years culture has played an important part of tourism and is increasingly in demand from tourists which is reflected in the Conwy Culture Centre. The development of this cultural centre was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2015 and a planning application was approved in 2017 which allows building and development to start. The Centre was planned to provide a safe space for youths to meet as well as a place to hold and display historic collections as well as offer training programmes and volunteer opportunities to locals who live in the area to improve their quality of live and the job aspects etc they are able to get. These aspects are all insightful of the ‘Conwy County Borough Council annual report 2016/17’ which explains how they had created a new strategy to increase the number of Welsh speakers (as well as the quality of the language that people who can speak the language were confident that they were able to speak). It also said that they had gained enough funding to be able to begin to develop the centre. As well as this it stated that heritage tourism within Conwy was increasing as a result of the changes that they made and that the volunteering support that was bring provided by the Conwy Culture Centre was worthwhile as two of the volunteers who took part were awarded with well-known awards (BBC Sports Wales young volunteer of the year).
Social Sustainability.
One of the four main indicators which are usually used to measure successful sustainability is the social aspects available in an area. Often studies into social sustainability include “housing, household structure, paid domestic work, material cultures of home and homelessness”. In attempt to reduce the rate of homelessness in Conwy, Conwy County Borough Council have made a five year strategy in 2013 (Local Housing Strategy). The aims of this strategy included making housing more affordable in attempt to allow the working population, those most likely to be renting homes, to remain in the area as housing is hard to afford. 2,200 homes in Conwy in 2015 were overcrowded as families could not afford large enough houses. Conwy County Borough Council (2015) also reveal that homelessness began to decrease in 2005, however overall, the rate of homeless in Conwy is lower than the national average for Wales. The Conwy Housing Solutions has an online help guide for those who are affected by homelessness and those that are expected to become homeless within 8 weeks and explains how Part 2 of the 2014 Housing (Wales) Act and Conwy County Borough Council (CCBC) can offer help. As well as homelessness in general studies have shown that there is often more homeless females than males and that this pattern is not being investigated enough and also that often, as women have different needs to men, women who are homeless suffer more from the effects of homelessness than men do.
Unemployment levels in Conwy in 2005 were 4% which was higher than the average for Wales at the time. One possible explanation for this could be due to the fact that in many places women still struggle to get jobs in 'male-dominated' fields such as farming and building therefore they often aren't able to get training or if they already have the necessary training they can find anyone to hire them. To try to change the problem with gender inequality in Conwy, CCBC have formed a ‘Strategic Equality Plan’ which was put into action in 2016. This plan attempts to contest gender inequalities in employment, pay and training by 2020.
Economic Sustainability.
Economic sustainability in Conwy is being planned by Conwy County Borough Council through the Conwy economic growth strategy 2017-2027. The creation of renewable energy has a great potential to increase the sustainable development of specific areas by creating a large selection of socioeconomic benefits such as improving regional and rural development opportunities, employment opportunities and the establishment of a domestic industry (del Río and Burguillo, 2009). There are five ambitions in Conwy’s economic growth strategy 2017-2027, one of them being to facilitate the tidal lagoon as mentioned earlier and other renewable energy projects across the county Conwy Council 2018. The tidal lagoon will create employment opportunities for the people of Conwy improving the sustainability of the local economy. Sourcing from small businesses can also improve the economic sustainability of local economies. Buying from small businesses can add to the development of the local economy in a variety of ways such as providing innovative green products and services (Walker and Preuss, 2008).
Conwy council want the local economy to be confident, resilient and sustainable. Conwy council will encourage new ideas and will work proactively with businesses to promote conditions in which they can grow. This is evidence that Conwy Council are aiming to effectively improve their local economy through the enhancement of local businesses that will in turn increase the economic sustainability of Conwy. Sustainable tourism is important for sustainable economic development. Appropriate policies are being applied within the Principality of Wales through the Wales Tourist Board to ensure successful sustainable tourism development (Owen, Witt and Gammon, 1993). An ambition of the Conwy Economic Growth Strategy 2017-2027 is to create winter tourism offer across the county making Conwy a year-round visitor destination Conwy Council (2018). This is an appropriate policy for Conwy as the area faces problems associated with seasonal tourism. The improvement of winter tourism in Conwy aims to counteract these problems and make the county a year-round tourist destination. Tourism is an important part of Conwy’s local economy and the creation of sustainable year-round tourism will further support the local economy, specifically in winter months. This will then improve the sustainable economic development of the County of Conwy. Higher education provides benefits to individuals and the society and must be considered when evaluating the economic sustainability of an area. Students who attend higher education obtain a wide range of personal and financial benefits (Baum et al, 2010). This would then support individuals in contributing to their local economy and its sustainable development. The Conwy County Borough council have recognised this and aim to establish a dedicated higher education presence in the county as outlined in the Conwy Economic Growth Strategy 2017-2027. This ambition will lay out a future for higher education institutions in the area and Wales as a whole. The increase in students attending higher education institutions shall then see a rise in financial benefits in Conwy County which will in turn promote the development of a sustainable economy in the area.
Summary.
In Summary Conwy has introduced a variety of schemes to help preserve the county for future generations. It is good to see that sustainability features so much in both the council’s Local development plan and corporate plan 2017-2022. It would be interesting to revisit this in the next five year and to see what goals featured in the corporate plan have been met and in particular developments on the proposed Tidal Lagoon in Colwyn Bay. For an area with such a diverse history and culture, it is good to see that both the council and communities want to preserve it for future generations.

= = = Anton Ažbe = = =
Anton Ažbe (30 May 1862 – 5/6 August 1905) was a Slovene painter and teacher of painting. He painted in the realist style. Less than 30 of his paintings and drawings survive. The National Gallery of Slovenia in Ljubljana holds most of his works. He was most famous for his private painting school which he opened in Munich in 1892. Many foreign students came to study with him including Alexej von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky.
Life and career.
Anton Ažbe and his twin brother Alois were born to a peasant family in Dolenčice, a small village in Slovenia. Their father died of tuberculosis when the boys were seven years old. Their mother had a very bad mental illness. She could not look after the farm or take care of the boys. A guardian took care of them. Anton had very poor health. He did not grow like a healthy child. He remained very short all his life. He also had problems with his spine and his legs. His guardian sent him to Klagenfurt as an apprentice to a merchant. After five years Ažbe ran away. He went to Ljubljana. In Ljubljana he met the painter Janez Wolf. He helped Wolf paint frescos in churches.
In 1880 Wolf helped Ažbe get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Ažbe studied for there for two years, but he did not like the academy's teaching method. He thought it was old-fashioned. In 1884 he moved to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. The Munich academy was much more modern. Ažbe did very well there. His teachers, Gabriel von Hackl and Ludwig von Löfftz, admired his work. The academy gave him a scholarship. He and his friend Ferdo Vesel, another art student, earned extra money by selling their drawings and paintings. They also earned money by helping other students with their painting and drawing assignments.
Ažbe finished his studies at the Munich academy in 1891. By that time he was already known for his portrait painting. His paintings were shown in art exhibitions at the Glaspalast. The Glaspalast was a large glass and iron exhibition building in the old botanical garden of Munich. It was modeled after the Crystal Palace in London. In 1892, Ferdo Vesel encouraged Ažbe to give private lessons to art students in Munich. He started with seven students who rented a room for their lessons, but the number grew very fast. Soon Ažbe was able to rent a building on 16 Georgenstrasse for the school. He also had his own studio on that street. The door to the school had a sign that said "Nur fest!" ("Be bold!"). The school became very famous. It specialised in painting nudes and portraits. Famous artists who studied at Ažbe's school included Alexej von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky.
Ažbe did all the teaching at the school by himself. This left little time for his own painting. In his later years Kandinsky wrote about his old teacher's generosity and kindness. Ažbe often gave free lessons to students who could not afford to pay. Ažbe died from cancer in 1905 at the age of 43. His obituary in a Munich newspaper described him as a man of great modesty and one of the city's "most original and best-known artistic personalities."

The original version of this game was called "Save The World" and was first introduced in 2011 with the name of Fortnite. In this mode, your mission is to save the survivors trapped in the storm zone. Fortnite has had 29 seasons, with the latest coming out in the morning of March 8, 2024.
Gameplay.
The game starts with up to 100 players. The player may join with other players to form a team of two to four players, or the player may play on their own. The main goal of the game is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. The round starts with weaponless players skydiving from floating buses (called "Battle Buses") into a region of land. The game is set in that particular environment with all of the weapons, health items and other combat support that is needed for players to survive. Opponents attack other players and defend themselves by building structures. Throughout the game, a purple storm approaching from outside the land will move closer and closer towards the center of the map. Any player caught in the storm will become damaged. This directs surviving players closer to each other, forcing them to have to fight against each other. During the match, supply drops that provide legendary weapons and items will appear in random locations. Similar to "", "Fortnite Battle Royale" is primarily played in third-person perspective (a type of perspective where the player controls the character as if they were around the character).
What makes "Fortnite Battle Royale" unique from other battle royale games is the new building system, originating from the original Fortnite game. Players may destroy objects in their environment to provide materials so that they can build fortifications (walls, roofs, floors, etc) that help protect them from enemies. Some fortifications can be built quickly, but they will be destroyed easily. Some fortifications, however, can be built slowly but resists attacks better. In Chapter 3 Season 2, a no-build mode was introduced that removes the building mechanic.
The game is free-to-play, however players have the option to make in-app purchases that earn extra V-Bucks. "Vinderbucks", or V-Bucks for short, allows players to purchase new skins for their characters, weapons, or dances. The player can also earn V-Bucks without in-app purchases through completing missions or challenges that can even include skins.
Ever since Fortnite Battle Royale was first released, Epic Games, the creator of the game, has added new features to it regularly. They frequently add new items and weapons for the game as well as fixing up any glitches or other critical problems in the game that affect gameplay via updates.
Seasonal changes.
Fortnite Battle Royale has "seasons" that last for about 10 weeks each. These seasons introduce a new theme, along with a new chapter in the game's storyline. Each season also brings new content, including new exclusive skins and new gameplay elements. There are currently 29 seasons, broken up into (mainly 4, excluding the new chapter 5 Season 1 update) 5 chapters.
On October 15, 2019, a new chapter was released to Fortnite Battle Royale. This added even more new gameplay like boats, fishing, new guns, a lot of guns and items being vaulted, and a completely new map.
Popularity.
The game quickly gained popularity, with over 10 million players playing the game within the first two weeks of release. As of March of 2019, Fortnite Battle Royale has 250 million players, exceeding the population of Canada.
"Fortnite Battle Royale" has also been popular with children, even though the game is all about shooting each other. The game's cartoonish art style, free-to-play nature (does not cost money to play the game), and being able to interact online makes it attractive to kids. Since the release of the mobile version of "Fortnite Battle Royale", many parents and teachers were concerned about how it affects children psychologically. Teachers have noticed that children are easily distracted when playing Fortnite. Epic Games, the creator of "Fortnite Battle Royale", responded by adding warning labels to the game's loading screens that the game should not be played during a class session.
Criticism.
Some agencies (organizations that service a special field) were worried that many children are not getting enough proper exercise and real-world social interaction because of playing games such as "Fortnite". Other agencies had warned parents that "Fortnite Battle Royale" causes children to do violent behavior. On April 2019, Prince Harry proposed that "Fortnite Battle Royale" should be banned. He believes "Fortnite Battle Royale" has a negative effect on society. He said, "The game should not be allowed, Its created to addict children. An addiction to keep you in front of a screen for as long as possible. It's so irresponsible."

Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty (also known as the Pratihara Empire) was a powerful dynasty in the Late Classical Period on the Indian subcontinent. This dynasty ruled most of the Northern states of India. This dynasty ruled India for a huge period from the 7th century to the 11th century. They had Ujjain as the capital and later shifted to Kannauj.
History.
Nagabhata I (730–756) was the first ruler of the dynasty. He extended his control east and south from Mandor. He conquered Malwa as far as Gwalior and the port of Bharuch in Gujarat.He established his capital at Avanti in Malwa. Nagabhata I was famously known for defeating the Arab army of the Ummayyad Caliphates under Junaid and Tamin. Kakushta and Devaraja are two weak rulers who succeeded Nagabhata I. Vatsaraja (775–805) was the next powerful ruler of the dynasty.
Conquest of Kannauj.
Kannauj kingdom was ruled by a weak ruler, after the death of Harshavardhana. The Pratiharas, The Palas and The Rashtrakutas fought to get control over Kannauj. But Vatsaraja of Pratihara defeated the Palas and the Rashtrakutas. Around 786, Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva (780–793) crossed the Narmada River into Malwa. From there he tried to capture Kannauj and defeated Vatsaraja. 
Vatsaraja was succeeded by Nagabhata II (805–833). Nagabhata II was initially defeated by the Rashtrakuta ruler Govinda III (793–814). But later recovered Malwa from the Rashtrakutas. He conquered Kannauj and the Indo-Gangetic Plain as far as Bihar from the Palas. He rebuilt the great Shiva temple at Somnath in Gujarat. Kannauj became the center of the Gurjara-Pratihara state. At this time, the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty covered much of northern India.
Rambhadra (833-c. 836) for a short time, succeeded Nagabhata II. Mihira Bhoja (c. 836–886) expanded the Pratihara dynasty west to the border of Sindh, east to Bengal, and south to the Narmada. His son, Mahendrapala I (890–910), expanded further eastwards in Magadha, Bengal, and Assam.
Decline.
Bhoja II (910–912) was the successor of Mahendrapala I . He was overthrown by Mahipala I (912–944). Many kingdoms emerged independent using the weakness of Pratiharas. The south Indian Emperor Indra III (c. 914–928) of the Rashtrakuta dynasty for a short time captured Kannauj in 916. Later again Pratihara ruler gained control over Kannauj. But the dynasty was still weakening due to the attacks of the Turks, Rashtrakutas and several other dynasties. Mahmud of Ghazni captured Kannauj in 1018, and the Pratihara ruler Rajapala fled (escaped). Somehow Rajapala was captured and killed by a Chandela Ruler named Vidhyadhara.The Chandela ruler then placed Rajapala's son Trilochanpala on the throne. Jasapala, the last Gurjara-Pratihara ruler died in 1036.

= = = Mastiff = = =
The Mastiff, also called the English Mastiff, is a large breed of dog. They have a rectangular body, thick muscles and a massive head with a wrinkled forehead. They stand from to at the shoulder and typically weigh between and . The Mastiff is one of the largest breeds of dogs who can outweigh many full-grown men. They can be gentle with family members but are also excellent guard dogs.
History.
The early Mastiff was called a molosser or molossus. Genetics and breeding dogs to get certain characteristics was unknown then. In 350 BC, Aristotle wrote that the ancestor of the Mastiff was the Molosser. These were the war dogs and guard dogs kept by the Molossoi people, an ancient Greek tribe. Today the two names are often used to mean the same group or family of dogs. For example, the modern St. Bernard is sometimes described as a mastiff and sometimes as a molosser type.
Mastiff or Molosser breeds.
While the Mastiff is a recognized breed, there are also a number of working dog varieties that are closely related to the Mastiff. Many prefer to class them as molosser breeds so as not to confuse them with the Mastiff dog breed. Currently there are about 14 different breeds in the molosser/mastiff family of dogs that are bred from or have a common ancestor with the Mastiff. These include the:
There are also a large number of dog breeds not called molossers or mastiffs, but are related to them. Some of these include the:
The list includes many more.
Training and temperament.
When training a Mastiff, it is important to recognize they have a certain personality type that needs additional time and patience to learn things. A Mastiff is a very relaxed dog and takes his or her time in doing a task. Owners call this the "Mastiff tempo". A Mastiff can't be trained the same as a Border Collie. In temperament, a modern Mastiff is a patient, sweet-tempered family guardian and companion. Gentle training works best. It is important to start that training early in puppyhood. They are a dog of tremendous size and strength and owning a Mastiff is a large responsibility.
Mastiffs are very predictable when they are facing a threat to their family. If an owner and another person act in a threatening way, the Mastiff will usually get between them to protect its owner. This is hard for the other person to miss and usually results in a cooling down of a heated discussion. But, if the situation does get worse, the Mastiff will usually growl or snarl at the other person as a warning. 
Early socialization is important so the Mastiff knows who belongs in the house and who does not. For example, if a Mastiff puppy sees strangers coming and going all the time, they tend to see this as normal and might not recognize an intruder if they see one. However, a properly trained and socialized Mastiff will usually corner a burglar or intruder. Unless the intruder does something foolish, like try to hurt the dog, he or she will probably not be hurt.

= = = Misophonia = = =
Misophonia (meaning "hatred of sound") is a rarely diagnosed mental disorder. It is a condition where certain sounds can cause someone to be angry or enraged. The sounds could be as simple as someone chewing food with their mouth open. Other examples include a ballpoint pen clicking (repeatedly), tapping, typing and other common sounds. The disorder has only been identified and named in the last 20 years. According to one sufferer, "It’s like a fight-or-flight response: Your muscles get tense, you’re on edge, your heart races, and you feel the urge to flee". Misophonia is often misdiagnosed as one of several psychological disorders. Sufferers often keep away from trigger sounds. There is no cure but it can be treated.
People with misophonia have different amounts of tolerance for triggering sounds. The presence of misophonia may be determined by specific diagnostic criteria. They all, however, result in anger and irritability. Many also have trouble focusing on normal activities while exposed to triggering sounds.
The cause of misophonia is not know. Some studies say that it affects more than 5% of the population.

= = = J1 (Y-DNA) = = =
Haplogroup J1, more fully Y DNA haplogroup J-M267, is a Y chromosome haplogroup found in the Middle East. This means it is found in a group of descendants from a single common ancestor in the father's line. It carries a mutation on the Y chromosome known as M267. This type of mutation is called a SNP, or a single nucleotide polymorphism, a change at one position in a gene's DNA. 
Y chromosomes are passed down from father to son without changing, so an SNP like this shows common ancestry.
The origin of this mutation was between 4,000 and 24,000 years ago.
This mutation followed a previous mutation, which created the haplogroup known as haplogroup J-P209 or simply haplogroup J, and so this makes the Y chromosome the "child" of the older version of the Y chromosome. Haplogroup J arose from a mutation which occurred about 31,700 years ago in Southwest Asia.

= = = Haplogroup = = =
A haplogroup is a group of single chromosomes, or single DNA strands, which share a common ancestor. They have the same mutation in all versions. 
Haplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.
In human genetics, the haplogroups usually studied are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. Both can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed only from father to son, while mtDNA is passed only from mother to children. Neither recombines, and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.

= = = Haplotype = = =
A haplotype is a term in genetics. It is short for haploid genotype. A haplotype is a collection of specific alleles (particular DNA sequences) in a cluster of tightly-linked genes on a chromosome. A cluster is usually inherited together. Put simply, haplotype is a closely-knit group of genes which a child inherits from one parent.
A second meaning of the term haplotype is a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) usually found together on a single chromatid (of a chromosome pair). So, finding a few alleles of a haplotype sequence identifies all other sites in its region. Such information is very valuable for investigating the genetics of common diseases.
Comparing haplotypes of two or more people shows the degree of genetic relationship between their respective lines. It is done in genetic genealogy projects.

= = = Single nucleotide polymorphism = = =
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced "snip"; plural "snips") is a DNA sequence variation in a population. A SNP is just a single nucleotide difference in the genome. 
For example, sequenced DNA fragments from two people, AAGCCTA to AAGCTTA, is different in a single nucleotide. In this case we say that there are two "alleles". Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles. SNPs occur most often in regions of the DNA which do not affect the survival of the organism: otherwise they would be weeded out by natural selection. Other factors, like genetic recombination and mutation rate, can also affect SNP density. There are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another.
These genetic variations between individuals (particularly in non-coding parts of the genome) are sometimes exploited in DNA fingerprinting, which is used in forensic science. Also, these genetic variations cause differences in our susceptibility to disease. The severity of illness and the way our body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations. For example, a single base mutation in the APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene is associated with a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.

= = = Myxobacteria = = =
The myxobacteria ("slime bacteria") are a group of bacteria that usuallly live in the soil. They feed on insoluble organic substances. They have very large genomes compared to other bacteria. Myxobacteria are included in the delta group of proteobacteria, a large group of Gram-negative forms.
Myxobacteria move by gliding on the surface. They travel in "swarms" with many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. The swarm puts out extracellular enzymes to digest food. This increases feeding efficiency. 
Life cycle.
When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into "fruiting bodies". These fruiting bodies are different shapes and colours, depending on the species. 
Inside the fruiting bodies, cells develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls. These myxospores, like spores in other organisms, survive until nutrients are more plentiful. Then cell growth is restarted with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, not just isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the amoebae called cellular slime moulds.
Uses.
Myxobacteria produce a number of biomedically and industrially useful chemicals, such as antibiotics, and export those chemicals outside of the cell. Some myxobacteria are used as model organisms for the study of development. At a molecular level, initiation of fruiting body development is regulated by Pxr sRNA.

A trans man (sometimes written as trans-man) is a female-to-male (FTM) transsexual or transgender person. Many people in this group like the name "trans man" over the many medical terms that are out there. Other non-medical names are t-boy, tg-boy and ts-boy.
Trans men were called girls when they were born, but they feel that they really are male. To show their true gender as men, trans men may transition from living as women to living as men. A trans man's transition can include telling family and friends, wearing different clothes, flattening the chest, using a new name, changing legal papers, using medical treatments of testosterone, and changing the body with surgery. Getting medical care can be more difficult for trans men because some doctors will not help them or they cannot afford it. Trans men can also face discrimination because they are transgender.
Not all trans men are straight (attracted to women). Some trans men are gay (attracted to men), bisexual, or asexual. Estimates of how many trans men there are range from 1 in every 30,000 people called girls at birth, to 1 in every 170 people called girls at birth.

"Thai people" usually refers to central and southern Thai (Tai Siam), northern Thai (Lanna) and Isan people. However, the term has a loose meaning and can sometimes refer to any person from Thailand, not only ethnic Thais.
About 60 million live in Thailand. Large populations have lived in Laos, Malaysia, Cambodia and Myanmar for many years.
Thai people most likely originally come from the province of Guangxi in China. Tai peoples began to move south some time between the 8th and 10th centuries. They settled in the valley of the Chao Phraya River. They became heavily influenced by Mon and Khmer and became Buddhist. Early Thai states included the Sukhothai Kingdom and Suphan Buri Province. The Thai were called "Siam" by the Khmer, and were ruled by the Khmer Empire. The Thai people began growing in power after they built Ayutthaya.

= = = Irish Civil War = = =
The Irish Civil War (; 28 June 1922 – 24 May 1923) followed the Irish War of Independence. It went along with the beginning of the Irish Free State. It was independent from the United Kingdom but stayed a part of the British Empire.
The conflict was between two opposing groups of Irish republicans over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The forces of the "Provisional Government" (which became the Free State in December 1922) supported the Treaty. The Republican opposition saw it as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). Many of those who fought in the conflict had been members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the War of Independence.
The Civil War was won by the Free State forces. They had many weapons provided by the British Government. The conflict may have claimed more lives than the War of Independence that went before it. It left Irish society divided and bitter for generations. About 927 people died during the civil war.

The Cobalt was available as a sedan and coupé, while the G5 was strictly a coupé in America and offered as a sedan model in Canada. It was replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze (a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti Premiere). The Pontiac G5 was replaced by the Buick Verano. As of 2014, GM was recalling this car because of problems with the ignitions that can shut off the engine without warning and cause disabled air bags and cause serious injury or death. Chevrolet Cobalt was considered an improvement over its predecessor the Cavalier because it earned a "Good" crash test rating from the IIHS, but without optional side airbags it earned a "Poor" in side impact tests. However, with the optional side airbags it earned an "Acceptable".

= = = Campaign for &quot;santorum&quot; neologism = = =
The campaign for the neologism "santorum" started with a contest held in May 2003 by Dan Savage. Savage is a sex columnist and LGBT rights activist. He asked his readers to create a definition for the word "santorum" in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's opinions about homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that "In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be." Savage announced the winning entry, which defined "santorum" as "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex". He created a web site, "spreadingsantorum.com" (and "santorum.com"), to promote the definition.
In 2010 Savage said he would take the site down if Santorum donated US$5 million plus interest to Freedom to Marry. That group supports legal recognition of same-sex marriages. In September 2011 Santorum asked Google to remove the definition from its search engine index. Google refused. They said that the company does not remove content from search results except in very limited circumstances.

Griffith then gave her a role in "A Romance of Happy Valley" (1919). The movie featured the popular acting team of Robert Herron and Lillian Gish. Dempster's first starring role came in the movie "The Girl Who Stayed at Home" (1919). Lillian Gish was supposed to get the role, but was reportedly "tired" and Griffith cast Dempster instead. Critics gave Dempster only mild praise. Her first solo starring role was in "The Love Flower" (1920). It was at this time critics began comparing her to Lillian Gish. But it was Griffith who directed her to sound like Gish and his other legendary female stars. It was about this time that Dempster became romantically involved with Griffith. Her first non-Griffith movie was in 1922. She starred in "Sherlock Holmes" with John Barrymore. Her movie "Isn't Life Wonderful?" (1924) was well received by critics. She starred in two movies with W. C. Fields for Paramount Pictures, "Sally of the Sawdust" (1925), and "That Royle Girl" (1925).

At that time it was inside the walls of the Kremlin. In 1491 the monastery was moved to new buildings on the banks of the Moskva River. It was called the "new monastery". 
In 1571 and 1591, the wooden buildings were attacked by the Crimean Tatars. In 1612, the Tsar, Michael of Russia, had the monastery completely rebuilt. This included the thick stone walls which made it one of the fortified monasteries on the edge of Moscow. These new stone walls were 7.5 meters high and 2 meters thick. They were 782 meters in length, and included six towers. These are the buildings which are still standing. The bell-tower, one of the tallest in Moscow, and the Sheremetev sepulchre in the church of the Sign, were added in the 18th century,
The monastery was supported by Andrei Kobyla's descendants, including the Sheremetyev and Romanov boyars. They used it as their burial vault. Among the last Romanovs buried in the monastery were Xenia Shestova (the mother of the first Romanov Tsar), Princess Tarakanova (a pretender who claimed to have been the only daughter of Empress Elisabeth) and Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia.

= = = Hebridean Terrane = = =
The Hebridean Terrane is one of the terranes that form part of the Caledonian orogenic belt in northwest Scotland. Its boundary with the neighbouring Northern Highland Terrane is formed by the Moine Thrust Belt.
The basement rock is formed by Archaean and Paleoproterozoic gneisses of the Lewisian complex. They are overlaid unconformably by the Neoproterozoic Torridonian sediments. This in turn is unconformably overlain by a sequence of Cambro–Ordovician sediments. It formed part of the Laurentian foreland during the Caledonian continental collision.
The Hebridean Terrane is the westernmost strip of mainland Scotland, most of the Inner Hebrides and all of the Outer Hebrides. Similar rocks are also thought to be present on Shetland. They have been proved west and north of the Outer Hebrides by BGS shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells. The full extent of this terrane to the west is obscured by the effects of Mesozoic rifting.
Some similar rocks occur in Shetland, which are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny,

= = = List of pharaohs = = =
This is a list of the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt. It starts in the Early Dynastic Period, before 3100 BC. It ends with the Ptolemaic Dynasty, when Egypt became a province of Rome under Augustus in 30 BC.
The dates given are approximate. The list of pharaohs uses the dates of Ancient Egypt, developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.
Old lists of pharaohs.
There are old lists of pharaohs which have been discovered. These are not complete:
Other lists can be found in Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Eratosthenes. Two other lists are not believed to be reliable, these are the work of "the Arabic writers", and the "Book of Sothis".
List.
In the legendary period, there were eight god kings who ruled over Egypt. The Palermo, Turin and Manetho king lists, have different names for the eight god kings.
The god kings were followed by kings who were part god and part human. The old lists are different in naming these rulers.
Archaic period.
The Archaic period includes the Early Dynastic Period, when Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were ruled as separate kingdoms.
Early Dynastic: Lower Egypt.
Lower Egypt was the northern Nile and the Nile Delta. The list may not be complete:
Early Dynastic: Upper Egypt.
Upper Egypt was the Nile Valley, south of the Delta. The following list may not be complete (there are many more of uncertain existence):
First Dynasty.
The First Dynasty ruled from about 3150 to 2890 BC.
In the interregnum between the first and second dynasties, two short lived pharaohs may have reigned :
Second Dynasty.
The Second Dynasty ruled c. 2890–2686 BC.
Old Kingdom.
The Old Kingdom was a peak of civilisation and achievement. This was the first of three so-called "Kingdom" periods which mark the high points of civilization in the Nile Valley. It began when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty (2686–2181 BC). Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity called the First Intermediate Period, or as the Egyptians called it, the "first illness."
The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was at Memphis. This is where Djoser set up his court. The Old Kingdom is known for the large number of pyramids. These were built as tombs for the pharoahs. The Old Kingdom is called "the Age of the Pyramids".
Third Dynasty.
The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.
Fourth Dynasty.
The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC. It included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built, Khufu (Cheops), Khafra (Chephren) and Menkaura (Mycerinus).
Fifth Dynasty.
The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2498 to 2345 BC.
Sixth Dynasty.
The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC.
First Intermediate Period.
The First Intermediate Period (2181–2060 BC) is between the end of the Old Kingdom and the start of the Middle Kingdom.
The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for 94 years, longer than any monarch in history, and died aged 100. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age.
The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.
Around 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. Another line of pharaohs at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable.
Around 2055 BC, Mentuhotep II, the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands. This was the start of the Middle Kingdom.
Seventh and Eighth Dynasties (combined).
The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from c. 2181 to c. 2160 BC. Many of the kings only ruled for a short time from Memphis, with Egypt divided into competing regions.
This table is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I, and the Turin canon.
Ninth Dynasty.
The Ninth Dynasty ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC. The Turin King List has 18 kings in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these, twelve names are missing and four are not complete.
Tenth Dynasty.
The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that ruled over Lower Egypt from 2130 to 2040 BC.
Eleventh Dynasty.
The Eleventh Dynasty was a local group from Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BC. The 11th dynasty came from a group of Theban nomarchs who served the kings of the 8th, 9th or 10th dynasty.
The successors of Intef the Elder, starting with Mentuhotep I, eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II.
Middle Kingdom.
The Middle Kingdom (2060–1802 BC) started at the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. Some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom began to trade outside of the kingdom. This opening of trade led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom, caused by an invasion from the Hyksos.
Eleventh Dynasty continued.
The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.
Twelfth Dynasty.
The Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BC. It is considered by later Egyptians to have been their greatest dynasty.
Second Intermediate Period.
The Second Intermediate Period (1802–1550 BC) was a time of chaos between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom. During this time, the Hyksos, who later became the Fifteenth Dynasty, arrived in Egypt.
The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.
The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV. About 1720 BC they took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab'a/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. About 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered Memphis, which ended the 13th dynasty. When the 13th dynasty collapsed, the 16th dynasty to declared its independence in Thebes. It was soon taken over by the Hyksos kings..
When the Hyksos left Upper Egypt, the Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom, forced the Hyksos out of Egypt and back into Asia

The position and identity of the following pharaohs is uncertain:
The Turin King List has extra names, but no other evidence has been found.
Fifteenth Dynasty.
The Fifteenth Dynasty was started by the Hyksos people who emerged from the Fertile Crescent. They ruled over much of the Nile region, from 1674 to 1535 BC.
Abydos Dynasty.
The Second Intermediate Period may include an independent dynasty reigning over Abydos from c. 1650 BC until 1600 BC. There are four known kings in the Abydos Dynasty, the order in which they ruled is unknown:
Sixteenth Dynasty.

The early 17th Dynasty may also have included Nebmaatre, whose dates are uncertain.
New Kingdom.
The New Kingdom (1550–1077 BC) includes the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th to the 11th century BC. It is between the Second Intermediate Period and the Third Intermediate Period.
During the New Kingdom, Egypt's armies were able to capture nearby countries. Egypt controlled Nubia in the south, and held territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria. During the New Kingdom, Egypt controlled more territory than at any other time in its history.
Two of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten and Ramesses II. Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, worshipped the god Aten. This is seen as the first monotheistic religion. Ramesses II was a powerful military ruler. He tried to recapture the territories in what is now modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. At the Battle of Qadesh he led the Egyptian armies in battle against the Hittite king Muwatalli II.
Eighteenth Dynasty.

Late period.
The Late Period runs from 732 BC to Egypt becoming a province of Rome in 30 BC, and includes periods of rule by Nubians, Persians, and Macedonians.
Twenty-fifth Dynasty.
Nubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye's reign. Piye's conquest of Lower Egypt established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC.
They were forced from Egypt back into Nubia, where they set up a kingdom at Napata (656–590), and, later, at Meroë (590 BC – 4th century AD).
Twenty-sixth Dynasty.

Argead Dynasty.
The Macedonians under Alexander the Great brought in the Hellenistic period with his capture of Persia and Egypt. The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC:
Ptolemaic Dynasty.
The second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. If two dates overlap, that means there was a co-regency. The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII. In modern times she is known simply as Cleopatra. She was the consort of Julius Caesar and after Caesar's death, of Mark Antony, and had children with both of them. Cleopatra tried to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome. This failed with the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony. Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. He reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt, from September 2, 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII, and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Between Cleopatra's death on August 12, 30 BC, up to his own death on August 23, 30 BC, he was the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian, who would become the Roman emperor Augustus, but there is no evidence.
Rome.
Cleopatra VII had affairs with the Roman Dictator Julius Caesar and Roman General Marc Antony. She killed herself when Antony was defeated by Octavian (later be Emperor Augustus). Egypt then became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Roman Emperors were given the title of Pharaoh, although exclusively while in Egypt. One Egyptian king-list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius. See the list of Roman Emperors.

= = = Defragmentation = = =
Defragmentation is a process that happens with digital files. Files are usually stored in one part. When a disk drive fills up, finding an empty space that is large enough becomes more difficult. When this happens, the file is split into different parts, and each part is stored on a different place in the disk. That process is known as fragmentation. Fragmentation happens because different parts of a file are not stored next to each other. When the file is read, the different parts must be assembled. Fragmented files take longer to assemble. Files that are stored in one part can be read faster. Defragmentation reverses fragmentation and puts the file into one piece.
The process.
Defragmentation is the process of rearranging the different parts, so that they are stored next to each other. This is usually done by copying them to a different place on the disk. Defragmentation is relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives. To read each part, the head of the hard disk needs to reposition itself to the area where the part is stored.
The problem of defragmentation is that it is takes a long time and in some cases, the file system cannot be changed while it is in progress. For that reason, defragmentation should not be done, when it can be avoided.
There are different kinds of files, some of them are modified more often. It is often a good practice to put them on different partitions, as most Unix-like operating systems do. Also, the design of hard drives has changed over time, which makes the effects of defragmentation less visible.
Media that uses flash memory, such as solid-state disks, do not benefit from defragmentation, as there are no moving parts than need to be re-positioned.

= = = Thelarche = = =
Thelarche means the development of breasts in human females during puberty (sexual development).
Development.
Generally, the left breast is the larger of the two. 
This usually begins when girls are about 9. A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola, which is the dark ring around the nipple. The lump in one breast may grow before the other one. This is called breast budding. Within 6-12 months, both breasts will have started growing. The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae. About 1 and a half to 2 years after the breasts first start growing, they are close to the shape and size of an adult woman's breasts. The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast. This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown. Breast size depends on the body's amount of fat.
Thelarchic stage.
It is the Tanner 2 stage of breast development (a scale used to analyze changes in people from childhood to adulthood). The first stage is the non-developed prepubescent state of breasts. Thelarche is usually the first sign of puberty. It usually occurs after age 8, and is the first evidence of puberty in 60% of women. It usually ends at age 13. However, it can sometimes happen earlier. When this happens, it can be by itself (called isolated premature thelarche). It could also be a wider pattern of precocious puberty (sexual development happening too early). 
Hormones.
The process is started by estradiol, the primary female sex hormone. Many young women are not prepared for thelarche, and this may result in stress. Teaching materials on breast development for elementary and middle schools has been suggested to promote breast health by reducing shame.

= = = Gonadarche = = =

= = = Law of the excluded middle = = =
The law of the excluded middle is a simple rule of logic. It states that for any proposition, there is no middle ground. Every proposition is either true or false.
Example.
For example, "Ginger is a cat" says the fact that Ginger is a cat. If it is true, then its opposite cannot also be true. If Ginger is a cat, then Ginger is not something else.
Mathematics.
In mathematics, the law of the excluded middle is a presupposition behind the proof by contradiction. Because of that, those who reject the validity of the law of the excluded middle (for example, the intuitionists) must also reject the validity of proof by contradiction as well.

= = = Okefenokee Swamp = = =
The Okefenokee is a swamp, a National Wildlife Refuge and a U.S. wilderness area. It is a shallow, , peat-filled wetland straddling the Georgia–Florida border in the United States. 
The Okefenokee is the largest "blackwater" swamp in North America. The term Okefenokee in Native American is "land of trembling earth". The swamp was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. The Okefenokee Swamp is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. 
The swamp was formed over the past 6,500 years by the build-up of peat in a shallow basin on the edge of an ancient Atlantic coastal terrace, the geological relic of a Pleistocene estuary. 
The swamp is bordered by Trail Ridge, a strip of higher land believed to have formed as coastal dunes or an offshore barrier island. The Suwanee River drains at least 90% of the swamp's watershed southwest towards the Gulf of Mexico. 
Longtime residents of the Okefenokee Swamp, "Swampers", are mostly of English ancestry. Due to their isolation, the Swampers used Elizabethan phrases and syntax well into the twentieth century. The Suwanee Canal was dug across the swamp in the late nineteenth century in a failed attempt to drain the Okefenokee. After the Suwanee Canal Company's bankruptcy, most of the swamp was bought by the Hebard family of Philadelphia, who logged cypress from 1909 to 1927. Several other logging companies ran railroad lines into the swamp until 1942; some remains are visible across swamp waterways. Most of the Okefenokee Swamp is included in the 403,000 acre (1630 km2) Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
A wildfire begun by a lightning strike near the center of the Refuge on May 5, 2007 eventually merged with another wildfire which began near Waycross, Georgia, on April 16 when a tree fell on a power line. By May 31, more than , or more than 935 square miles, had burned in the region.
The Okefenokee Swamp Alliance is a conservation group that works for the continued preservation of the swamp.

= = = Blackwater river = = =
A blackwater river is a river with a deep, slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands. Its colour is caused by the decaying vegetation. As vegetation decays, tannins leach into the water, making a transparent, acidic water that is darkly stained, looking like tea or coffee.
Most rivers in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States are blackwater rivers. Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black soil, are black due to the color of the soil. These rivers are "black mud rivers" or estuaries.
Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ both from whitewater and clearwater rivers.
The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853.

= = = European green woodpecker = = =
The European green woodpecker ("Picus viridis"), or European green woodpecker, is a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. It occurs in most of Europe and in western Asia. There are four subspecies. All have green upperparts, paler yellowish underparts, and a red crown.
The woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species. It is a shy bird but usually draws attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19–20 days.
It gives a loud call known as yaffling.
Old deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, plantations, orchards and lawns.

= = = Honeyguide = = =
Honeyguides (family Indicatoridae) are near-passerine birds of the order Piciformes. They are also known as 'indicator birds', or 'honey birds'.
They have an Old World tropical distribution, with most species in Africa and two in Asia. These birds are known for their interaction with humans. One or two species will deliberately lead humans to bee colonies, so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind.
Brooding.
The breeding behavior of eight species in "Indicator" and "Prodotiscus" is known. They are all brood parasites that lay an egg in a nest of another species. Most prefer hole-nesting species, often the related barbets and woodpeckers, but "Prodotiscus" parasitizes cup-nesters such as white-eyes and warblers. Honeyguide nestlings have been known to throw out their host's chicks from the nest. They have hooks on their beaks with which they puncture the hosts' eggs or kill the nestlings.
African honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as cuckoo hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the host.

= = = Brood parasitism = = =
Brood parasites are animals, usually birds, which trick other species to raise their young. The best-known example is the cuckoo. Brood parasitism works because the parasite develops faster than the resident eggs, kills its nestmates and turfs them out of the nest. The adult birds cannot tell the difference in the young, and spend their time raising the offspring of another species. In some cases, the parasite has the ability to make the begging cheeps of the host species.
The strength of defences and counter-adaptation rely on the species' ability to evolve. Some host species have very strong rejection defences. This makes the parasitic species evolving to have very close mimicry. But in other species, hosts do not reject the foreign egg. As a result, the parasitic species shows no egg mimicry.
Similar methods are used by some fish and insects.

= = = East London = = =
East London is the northeastern part of London. It is east of the City of London.
It does not have an official definition. The idea has its origins in 1720 as "That part beyond the Tower". By 1950 it was called East London and included all of Greater London east of the City of London and north of the River Thames. This area now makes up the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest. It includes one of the highest ethnic minority populations in the country, mostly families of South Asian origin.
The East End of London is a subset of East London, corresponding to areas closer to the ancient City. 
The early development of London eastward was caused by shipping on the River Thames. There were docks and shipbuilding. These industries declined after World War II. Felixstowe is now used as the main container port of southern England. East London is now an area of regeneration. 
Areas further east developed in the Victorian and Edwardian eras following the expansion of the railways in the 19th century. In Tower Hamlets the population peaked in 1891 and growth was restricted to the outer boroughs. By 1971 the population had peaked in every borough and the entire area was experiencing population decline. By the time of the 2011 census this had reversed and every borough had some growth in population.
Many famous places like Spitalfields, Brick Lane and Shoreditch are in East London.

= = = AIDS (MS-DOS) = = =
AIDS is a computer virus that infects .COM and .EXE files. In MS-DOS, the .COM and .EXE files run programs including the operating system. When a computer is infected with this virus, it loads the virus into the computer memory. There, the AIDS virus may infect another .COM or .EXE file each time it is run. AIDS writes on the first 13,952 bytes of an infected executable file. These corrupted files have to be deleted and replaced by non-corrupted backups to remove the virus. 
This virus is also known as the "Hahaha virus" in Europe. IBM calls it the "Taunt virus". When an infected computer starts up, it displays a message, with AIDS covering about half of the screen. The system is then halted. It is impossible to recover the original information of the file on the rewritten part.

= = = Law of noncontradiction = = =
The law of non-contradiction is a rule of logic. It states that if something is true, then the opposite of it is false. For example, if an animal is a cat, the same animal cannot be not a cat. Or, stated in logic, if +p, then not -p, +p cannot be -p at the same time and in the same sense. The law was stated as a principle of mathematical logic by Russell and Whitehead in "Principia Mathematica". 
Ravi Zacharias has said most eastern philosophies reject the law of noncontradiction. The law of non-contradiction is found in ancient Indian logic as a rule in the "Shrauta Sutras", the writing of , and the "Brahma Sutras" attributed to Vyasa. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as Madhvacharya. The idea of noncontradiction is rejected in some strands of Buddhism.

= = = Pan American World Airways = = =
Pan American World Airways, or Pan Am, was once the largest airline of the USA. The crash of Pan Am Flight 103 and several other factors led to the airline to stop flying in 1991.
History.
Pan Am was founded in 1926. Its first flights were from Key West, Florida to Havana, Cuba. During the 1920s and 1930s, Pan Am bought several smaller airlines in Central America and South America. These were bought to help Pan Am expand its flights throughout The Americas. Pan Am became the first airline to circumnavigate the world in 1942. By the 1950s, Pan Am had several larger airplanes like the Boeing 377, Douglas DC-6 and the Lockheed Constellation. It went to cities all across the world. In 1959, Pan Am bought its first jet - the Boeing 707. In 1970, Pan Am introduced its first widebody jet - the Boeing 747.
In 1980, Pan Am was combined with National Airlines. This was because Pan Am wanted to fly domestic flights and the government didn't allow it. When Pan Am bought National, it could finally fly domestically. In the 1980s, Pan Am started having many financial problems, having paid too much to buy National Airlines. Pan Am also spent too much money on the new Boeing 747s. The Gulf War of 1990 also caused many problems with Pan Am's transatlantic flights. Pan Am declared bankruptcy in January 1991. Delta Air Lines bought small parts of Pan Am and tried to help it. However, on December 4, 1991 Pan Am stopped flying due to the big financial problems.

= = = Joint State Political Directorate = = =
The Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU; ) was the secret police of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1934. It was after the Cheka and before the NKVD. Its official name was the Joint State Political Directorate. 
The OGPU was theoretically supposed to operate with more restraint than the original Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka. The OGPU's powers were greatly increased in 1926, when the Soviet criminal code was amended to include a section on "anti-state terrorism". The law were vaguely written and very broadly interpreted. Even before then, it set up tribunals to try the most exceptional cases of terrorism, usually without calling any witnesses. In time, the OGPU's powers grew even greater than those of the Cheka.
Perhaps its most spectacular success was the Trust Operation of 1924–1925. OGPU agents contacted émigrés in western Europe and pretended to be on a large group working to overthrow the communist regime, known as the "Trust". Exiled Russians gave the Trust large sums of money and supplies, as did foreign intelligence agencies. The Trust finally succeeded in luring one of the leading anti-Communist operators, Sidney Reilly, into Russia to meet with the Trust. Once he was in Russia, he was captured and killed. It was a great propaganda success.
From 1927 to 1929, the OGPU engaged in intensive investigations of an opposition coup. Stalin soon made a public decree that any and all opposition views should be considered dangerous and gave the GPU the authority to seek out hostile elements. There were many trials during Stalin's Five Year Plan. 
The OGPU was responsible for the creation of the Gulag system. It also became the Soviet government's arm for the persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Greek Catholics, the Latin Catholics, Islam and other religious organizations. The OGPU was also the main secret police agency for the detection, arrest, and liquidation of anarchists and other dissident left-wing factions in the early Soviet Union.
The OGPU was merged into the newly created all-union People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in July 1934. Its last change was into the more widely known Committee for State Security (KGB).

= = = Black Sabbath (song) = = =
"Black Sabbath" is a song by the English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, written in 1969 and released on their self-titled first album. In 1970, the song appeared as an A-side on a four-track 12-inch single, with "The Wizard" also on the A-side and "Evil Woman" and "Sleeping Village" on the B-side, on the Philips Records label Vertigo. In Japan and the Philippines, a 7-inch single on the Philips label was released with "Evil Woman, Don't Play Your Games with Me" on the A-side and "Black Sabbath" on the B-side.
Ice-T sampled the song on his 1989 song "Shut Up, Be Happy" and his 1991 song "Midnight". Other musicians have done covers of this song. One of them was Beth Gibbons of Portishead.
History.
According to the band, the song was inspired by an experience that bassist Geezer Butler had in the days of Earth. Butler had recently become obsessed with the occult,so he painted his apartment matte black and placed several inverted crucifixes and pictures of Satan on the walls. Ozzy Osbourne gave Butler a black occult book as a gift. It was written in Latin and decorated with numerous pictures of Satan. Butler read the book and then placed it on a shelf beside his bed before going to sleep. When he woke up, he claims he saw a large black figure standing at the end of his bed, staring at him. The figure vanished and Butler ran to the shelf where he had placed the book earlier, but the book was gone. Butler related this story to Osbourne, who then wrote the lyrics to the song based on Butler's experience. The song starts with the lyrics:
"What is this that stands before me?"
"Figure in black which points at me."
A version of this song from Black Sabbath's first demo exists on the Ozzy Osbourne compilation album "The Ozzman Cometh". The song has an extra verse with additional vocals before the bridge. The guitar and bass are tuned down one whole step, resulting in the key position of A being played on the fretboard, but having the pitch as G (octave - D flat) to the listener. It's one of the band's most frequently performed tracks, being featured on every single tour of their career.

= = = Prisoner's dilemma = = =
The prisoner's dilemma is a paradox about co-operation. It shows why two "rational" individuals might not co-operate, even if it seems in their best interests. It is studied in game theory.
Game structure.
Setup.
The police catch two criminals after they committed a crime. The police do not know which person committed the crime and which person just helped. They question the two in separate cells. Each prisoner can either stay silent or betray (hurt) the other by blaming the crime on them. If both stay silent, they only go to jail for 2 years. If one betrays and the other stays silent, the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years and the other one does not go to jail at all. If they both betray each other, they each go to jail for 5 years. No matter what happens, the prisoners will never see each other again.
Strategies.
If you are a prisoner in this situation and you care only about yourself, the way to get the smallest sentence is to betray the other prisoner. No matter what, you get a shorter sentence when you betray than when you do not.
If the other prisoner stays silent and does not betray, then betraying means you do not go to jail at all instead of going to jail for 6 months.
If the other prisoner betrays, then betraying lets you go to jail for 5 years instead of 10 years. In other words, it's always best for you to betray, even though the two of you would be better off if you both stayed silent. Betraying the other prisoner is your "dominant strategy" because it is always the best thing for you to do, no matter what the other prisoner does.
The prisoner's dilemma does not have same result if some of the details are different.
Game theory was much studied during the Cold War period. In that case the "players" being studied were the United States and the Soviet Union.

= = = Cædmon's Hymn = = =
Cædmon's "Hymn" is a short Old English poem originally composed by Cædmon. It was about God. It survives in a Latin translation by Bede in his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum" and in other dialects written down in several manuscripts of Bede's "Historia". Bede wrote about the poet and his work in the fourth book of his "Historia". 
Cædmon.
Bede told the story of Cædmon who was an illiterate cow-herder who was suddenly able to recite a Christian song of creation in Old English verse. This miracle happened after Cædmon left a feast when they were passing a harp around for all to sing a song. He left the hall after feeling ashamed that he could not contribute a song. Later in a dream he said a man appeared to him and asked him to sing a song. Cædmon responded that he could not sing. But the man told him that he could and asked him to “Sing to me the beginning of all things.” Cædmon was then able to sing verses and words that he had not heard of before. Cædmon then reported his experience first to a steward then to Hild the abbess. She invited scholars to evaluate Cædmon’s gift. Cædmon was sent home to turn more divine doctrine into song. The abbess was so impressed with the success of his gift that she told him to become a monk. Cædmon lived a long and very productive life as a monk. He created songs from all kinds of Church history and doctrine.
Choral settings of Caedmon's Hymn.
The text has been set to music by a number of composers of choral music. Graham Keitch used Bede's translation for a motet which was commissioned to mark the 1100th anniversary of the death of the Anglo Saxon queen, Aethelflaed. It was first sung during the commemorative Evensong for Queen Aethelflaed which took place in Gloucester Cathedral, June 12th 2018.

= = = Appeal = = =
In law, an appeal is how legal cases are reviewed. An appeal is made to a higher court than the one that made the initial judgment. This is usually an appeals court. In turn, appeals court decisions may be appealed in a supreme court. The person pursuing an appeal is called an appellant.
When a lower court judgement is filed, the losing party (appellant) must file a notice of appeal. The appellant must give the appeals court legal reasons for reversing the decision of the lower court. Usually the legal argument includes legal precedents that relate to this case. The other party, called a respondent or appellee files a brief that counters the claims of the appellant. In turn, the appellant may counter the response of the appellee with a final brief. Then, if the appeals court agrees to hear the case each party argues their case before the court. The appeals court may sustain the original court ruling. They may also reverse the decision sending it back to the lower court. No new evidence is introduced in an appeals court.

Plot.
A grandfather visits his grandson, who is sick and must stay at home. The grandfather reads him a story, and says it is full of fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, and miracles. The grandson does not believe it will be good but agrees to try and stay awake, and sometimes interrupts as his grandfather tells the story. 
A beautiful young woman named Buttercup lives on a farm, in a land called Florin. Whenever she tells the farmhand Westley to do some work, he always does the work and his only answer is "As you wish." She eventually realizes that he truly means "I love you" and she realizes that she loves him too. He is poor and they do not have enough money to get married. He leaves to seek his fortune, but his ship is attacked by a famous pirate, the Dread Pirate Roberts, who is known for never taking prisoners, and Westley is believed dead.
Five years later, Buttercup is forced to marriage Prince Humperdinck, the prince of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a short Sicilian boss named Vizzini, a giant from Greenland named Fezzik, and a Spanish fencing master named Inigo Montoya, who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who killed his father. Soon the outlaws are pursued by a masked man in black, and also by Prince Humperdinck and his soldiers. 
The man in black catches up to the outlaws at the top of the Cliffs of Insanity. He defeats Inigo in a sword fight and knocks him unconscious. He wrestles the giant Fezzik, and put him to sleep using a choke hold. He outsmarts Vizzini, tricking him into drinking from a cup containing poison. He takes Buttercup prisoner and they flee. They stop to rest near the top of steep hill. Buttercup guesses that he is the famous Dread Pirate Roberts, and is angry with him for killing Westley. Buttercup sees Humperdinck and his soldier in the distance and pushes Roberts down the hill and wishes death upon him. As he tumbles down, he shouts, "As you wish!" Buttercup realizes Westley was pretending to be the Dread Pirate Roberts, and she throws herself down the hill after him and they are reunited. Westley explains the Dread Pirate Roberts is not one person, but a name passed on when the pirate wants to retire. They must pass through the dangerous Fire Swamp, and avoid hungry animals that live there. They survive the fires and the rodents of unusual size (ROUS), but are captured as they leave by prince Humperdinck and his cruel assistant Count Rugen, who has six fingers on each hand. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's release. Humperdinck secretly orders Rugen to lock Westley in his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair.
When Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley. His real plan all along had been to start war with the neighboring country of Guilder by making it look like they had killed Buttercup. Meanwhile, Inigo and Fezzik reunite after Humperdinck orders the thieves arrested in the nearby forest, and Fezzik tells Inigo about Rugen. Inigo decides that they need Westley's help to get into the castle. Buttercup is sad and angry with Humperdinck when she learns that he has not tried to find Westley. Humperdinck locks Buttercup in her room, and tortures Westley to death. In the forest Inigo and Fezzik are able to hear Westley cry out in pain, as he dies. They find Westley's body and bring him to a folk healer, called Miracle Max. Max used to work for the king of Florin but was fired by Humperdinck, and at first says he cannot help but agrees because he does not like Humperdinck. He discovers that Westley is not dead but only "mostly dead" because of his true love for Buttercup. Max brings Westley back to life, but Westley cannot move his body, and needs more time to recover. 
After Westley, Inigo and Fezzik get inside the castle, Humperdinck is scared and tries to finish the wedding quickly. Inigo finds and Rugen the six-fingered man who killed his father. He fights him in a duel to the death, saying to him again and again: "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." Westley finds Buttercup, who was about to kill herself, and tells her the marriage was not real because she never said "I do". Still unable to move, he wastes time and tells Humperdinck all the terrible things he will do to him if they fight. His bluff works and without fighting Humperdinck gives up. Together the leave the castle, Westley rides away with Buttercup, and Inigo and Fezzik. Westley and Buttercup share a kiss. 
The boy asks his grandfather to read the story to him again the next day, to which the grandfather replies, "As you wish."

= = = Crossbill = = =
The crossbills are a genus, "Loxia", of birds in the finch family (Fringillidae). There are three to five (or possibly many more) species. 
These birds have mandibles with crossed tips, which gives the group its English name. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.
Crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones. The unusual bill shape is an adaptation to get seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grow. They move ("erupt") out of the breeding range if the cone crop fails. Crossbills breed very early in the year, often in winter months. This is the time to get the most cones.
They put their beak slightly open between the scales of conifer cones. Then they close their beaks and the tips push the scales apart. This lets them get at the seed (usually two seeds per scale). The point is that, as cones mature, they tend to open when dry and close when wet.
Eventually they fall, and lie on the ground. As they dry the scales naturally open, and any animal can get at the seeds. With their beaks, crossbills can get at the seeds much earlier than any other animal.
Food preferences.
Each species' bill shape is optimised for opening seeds from different species of conifer. Their preferred food sources are:
The relationships between crossbill species has been much studied.

Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is a 2015 indie point-and-click survival horror video game developed by Scott Cawthon. It is the third entry in the "Five Nights at Freddy's" series. The game was released on Steam on March 2, 2015, then for Android devices on March 7, 2015. The game is set 30 years after "Five Nights at Freddy's".
The player assumes the role of a newly hired employee at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed amusement park attraction that pays homage to the original Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. In addition, the player must monitor the status of three operating systems - cameras, audio, and ventilation - and reboot them whenever they begin to malfunction. They have to defend from Springtrap and the 'phantoms', which are more ghostly and burnt-looking versions of the animatronics from the previous games, including Golden Freddy, Chica, Withered Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and Phantom Puppet. These animatronics cannot physically hurt you, but every time they catch you, one of the systems then needs to be rebooted. While Phantom Mangle does not jumpscare directly, it can appear in the hall or on one of the cameras and emit a garbled static sound, causing the audio system to have to be rebooted. The only animatronic that can cause a game over is Sprintrap, the main antagonist, and he is attracted to sound. The only way to get him to not kill you is by playing audio of Balloon Boy laughing from "Five Nights at Freddy's 2." If you play this audio on a camera close to Springtrap, Springtrap will go towards it. He is also attracted to Mangle's loud garbled audio sounds, so if Mangle is in the hallway making noise, he will go towards your office faster.

Kimberlite is an igneous rock best known for sometimes containing diamonds. It is named after the town of Kimberley in South Africa. The discovery of a big diamond in 1871 started a "diamond rush". This resulted in the Big Hole, a large open mine.
Kimberlite occurs in the Earth's crust in vertical structures known as "pipes" as well as igneous dykes and sills. Kimberlite pipes are the most important source of mined diamonds today. Kimberlites form deep with the Earth's mantle. Formation occurs at depths between Kimberlite material is erupted rapidly and violently, often with considerable carbon dioxide and other volatile components. 
Kimberlite has attracted attention because it serves as a carrier of diamonds and garnet peridotite mantle xenoliths to the Earth's surface. The study of kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition of the lower mantle. Little is known about melting processes at or near the interface between the cratonic continental lithosphere and the underlying convecting asthenospheric mantle.

= = = Chickasaw = = =
The Chickasaw are a Native American people. They are from the Southeastern Woodlands of North America. Before Europeans came to America, they lived in the area of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. They speak the Chickasaw language. This language is in the Muskogean language family. The Chickasaw are federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation.
The Chickasaw first lived in western North America. Before the first European contact, they moved to east of the Mississippi River. They settled mostly in what is now northeast Mississippi. They were living here when European explorers and traders came. They had relationships with the French, English and Spanish during the colonial years. The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes. The tribe had advanced social structures and did many things that European Americans did. The US forced them to sell their land in 1832. They also forced them to move to the Indian Territory (Oklahoma) during the 1830s.
Most Chickasaw now live in Oklahoma. The Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is the 13th largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. Its members are related to the Choctaw and share a common history with them. The Chickasaw are divided into two groups: the "Impsaktea" and the "Intcutwalipa". They traditionally followed a system of matrilineal descent. Some property was controlled by women. Leadership in the tribe passed from a mother to her children.
Etymology.
The name "chickasaw" originally belonged to a Chickasaw leader. "Chickasaw" is the English spelling of "Chikashsha" (). This means "rebel" or "comes from Chicsa".
History.
The origin of the Chickasaw is not known for certain. Twentieth-century scholars, such as the archeologist Patricia Galloway, think that the Chickasaw and Choctaw came from the Plaquemine culture and other groups whose ancestors had lived in the Lower Mississippi Valley for thousands of years. The Chickasaw and Choctaw then became distinct peoples in the 17th century. When Europeans first encountered them, the Chickasaw were living in villages in present-day South Carolina and northeastern Mississippi.
The Chickasaw may have been migrants to the area. Their oral history says that they moved from west of the Mississippi River into present-day Mississippi in prehistoric times.
Another version of the Chickasaw creation story is that they came out of the ground at "Nanih Waiya," a great mound built about 300 CE by Woodland peoples.
In 1540 the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto encountered the ancestors of the Chickasaw and stayed in one of their towns. After various disagreements, the American Indians attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying it. The Spanish moved on quickly.
The Chickasaw began to buy guns from the British after the colony of Carolina was founded in 1670. They used these weapons to raid the Choctaw. They captured some members and sold them into Indian slavery to the British. When the Choctaw started buying guns from the French, the slave raids stopped.
Allied with the British, the Chickasaw had battles with the French and the Choctaw in the 18th century, such as in the Battle of Ackia on May 26, 1736. They continued until France was defeated by the British in the Seven Years' War (called the French and Indian War in North America).
After the American Revolutionary War, the Chickasaw were allies of the new United States and fought against the Indians of the old Northwest Territory. The Shawnee and other Northwest Indians were defeated in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.
Relations with the United States.
George Washington (first U.S. President) and Henry Knox (first U.S. Secretary of War) proposed the cultural transformation of Native Americans. Washington believed that Native Americans were equals of white people, but that their society was not as good. He came up with a policy to "civilize" them, and Thomas Jefferson continued it. Washington's plan included impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; and punishing those who violated Indian rights.
The government appointed Indian agents. They lived among the Indians to teach them how to live like whites. In the 19th century, the Chickasaw increasingly adopted European-American practices, as they established schools, adopted yeoman farming practices, converted to Christianity, and built homes in styles like their European-American neighbors.
Treaty of Hopewell (1786).
The Chickasaw signed the Treaty of Hopewell in 1786. This treaty officially recognized peace between the Chickasaw and the United States.
Treaty of 1818.
In 1818, the leaders of the Chickasaw signed a treaty giving up all land north of the southern border of Tennessee. The Chickasaw kept a four-square-mile reservation, but were required to lease the land to European immigrants.
Removal era (1837).
The Chickasaw received $3 million U.S. dollars from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836, the Chickasaw agreed to purchase land in Indian Territory from the Choctaw. They paid the Choctaw $530,000 for the western part of their land. For nearly 30 years, the US did not pay the Chickasaw the $3 million it owed them for their territory in the Southeast.
The Chickasaw gathered at Memphis, Tennessee, on July 4, 1837, with all of their portable assets: belongings, livestock, and enslaved African Americans. Three thousand and one Chickasaw crossed the Mississippi River. During the journey, often called the Trail of Tears by all the Southeast tribes that had to make it, more than 500 Chickasaw died of dysentery and smallpox.
When the Chickasaw reached Indian Territory, the United States merged them with the Choctaw nation. The Chickasaw wrote their own constitution in the 1850s.
American Civil War (1861).
The Chickasaw Nation became allies of the Confederate States of America in 1861. They did this because the United States government had forced them off their lands and did not protect them against the Plains tribes in the West. Confederate officials suggested that the American Indian tribes would receive an independent Indian state if the Confederacy won.
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was made the Confederate envoy to Native Americans. He negotiated several treaties, including the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws in July 1861. The treaty covered many things, such as the sovereignty of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nation, the possibility of citizenship in the Confederate States of America, and a delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. Because the Chickasaw sided with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, they had to give up some of their land after the war. The US also freed all the slaves owned by the Chickasaw. Members of the Chickasaw who returned to the United States were given US citizenship.
Post–Civil War.
Because the Chickasaw were on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War, the United States government made a new peace treaty with them in 1866. It required that they free their slaves and give citizenship to freed slaves who wanted to stay in the Chickasaw Nation. The freed slaves and their descendants became known as the Chickasaw Freedmen. However, the Chickasaw Nation did not give citizenship to the Chickasaw Freedmen. Descendants of the Freedmen continue to live in Oklahoma.
The Chaloklowa Chickasaw Indian People were recognized as a "state-recognized group" by South Carolina in 2005. Their headquarters is in Hemingway, South Carolina. In 2003, they asked the US Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs for federal recognition, but they did not receive it.
Government.
In the twentieth century, the Chickasaw became independent from the Choctaw and re-established their government. They are now federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation. The tribe's government is headquartered in Ada, Oklahoma.
Culture.
Chiefs have the suffix "-mingo" at the end of their names. For example, "Tishomingo" was the name of a famous Chickasaw chief.
In 2010, the tribe opened the Chickasaw Cultural Center in Sulphur, Oklahoma.

= = = Television station = = =
A television station is a commercial business or organization that transmits their signals directly to television receivers (TV sets). It usually has a studio for making TV shows. Television transmissions can be broadcast using analog television signals or digital television signals. Broadcast television standards are set by the government. These standards vary around the world. Analog television stations usually broadcast their signals on one television channel. Digital television stations broadcast their signals over one or more subchannels.
The term "television stations" is normally applied to earth-based television stations and not to cable television or satellite television broadcasting. Television stations usually require a broadcast license from a government agency. That agency sets the rules which television stations must follow. In the United States, for example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licenses television channels.
Affiliates.
In the United States, stations are normally either "affiliates" or "independants". Affiliates are stations that are a part of a network. Most networks are nation-wide. Affiliates get much of the programs that they broadcast from the network. It is common for affiliates to broadcast the programs it gets from the network during the primetime hours of 8pm to 11pm and broadcast syndicated or local programing during the rest of the day. Local programing often includes local news, weather and traffic reports. Independant station are not a part of a larger network. They normally provide locally created or syndicated programs and movies.
For example, KTLA is the CW affiliate in Los Angeles. They broadcast programs that are provided to them by the national network The CW. It also broadcast locally created sports and news programs.

= = = Luxembourg Palace = = =
The Luxembourg Palace (known in French as the Palais du Luxembourg) is a former royal palace in Paris, France. Since 1958 it has been the seat of the French Senate of the Fifth Republic.
Brief history.
The palace was originally built in 1612 by Marie de' Medici on lands she owned. The design was based on buildings from her native Florence. The building is often compared to the far larger Palazzo Pitti where Queen Marie was born in 1575. In 1642, Marie left the Luxembourg to her second and favourite son, Gaston, Duke of Orléans. He called it the "Palais d'Orléans" but it was still known by its original name. Upon Gaston's death, the palace passed to his widow, Marguerite of Lorraine. Then it passed to his elder daughter by his first marriage, La Grande Mademoiselle. In 1660, Anne de Montpensier sold the Luxembourg to her younger half-sister, Élisabeth Marguerite d'Orléans, Duchess of Guise. The Duchess, in turn, gave it to her cousin, king Louis XIV, in 1694. In 1717 Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France gave the palace to his favourite daughter the Duchess of Berry. The building became infamous for the duchess's parties and sexual activities. She also hosted Peter the great there in 1717. The pregnancies of the young widow make scandal. At the end of March 1719, a new confinement badly prepared by her excesses, goes very badly. On the verge of death, she begs for extreme unction, which the church refuses her. On April 2, she is delivered of a stillborn child. Disgraced by the rumors of this birth, which all Paris talks about, the princess does not recover and dies in July at the castle of La Muette. At the autopsy, the doctors find her pregnant once again.
Sometime after the French Revolution it became a prison. During World War II it was a headquarters for the Luftwaffe.

Assistant Commissioner of Police Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan), a no-nonsense cop, is called onto the case. Dixit seeks the help of a local bike dealer/racer named Ali Akbar Fateh Khan (Uday Chopra) and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. Kabir (John Abraham), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit, claiming that Dixit can't catch him even if he is right in front of him.

Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar is a judge. She was the president of one of Guatemala’s two High Risk Court Tribunals. A High Risk Court Tribunal is a kind of court that has authority in difficult cases. The cases are likely to cause people to become upset because they are related to politics or government.
In 2014, Barrios received an International Women of Courage Award from the United States Department of State.
Barrios was in charge of the trial of Efraín Ríos Montt, who ruled Guatemala with total authority. This trial was the first time a national court tried a former leader of a country for genocide. That trial decided that Montt was responsible for committing the crime of genocide against Ixil Mayans. The trial finished in 2013.
However, on May 20th, 2013, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala decided that the decision was wrong and changed the decision. It ordered the trial to start again, because of a disagreement over the judges. Officials said that Ríos Montt's trial will start again in January 2015.
In April 2014, Barrios' authority as a judge was suspended for a year. This was because of a complaint against her by a lawyer who had a part in the trial of Efrain Rios Montt.

During his speech, he repeatedly criticized the Democratic Party, calling it an "absolute failure" and blaming it for the election of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
 I’m often asked by the media and others: How did it come about that Donald Trump, the most unpopular presidential candidate in the modern history of our country, won the election? And my answer is—and my answer is that Trump didn’t win the election; the Democratic Party lost the election. Let us—let us be very, very clear: The current model—the current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure. This is not—this is not my opinion. This is the facts. You know, we focus a lot on the presidential election, but we also have to understand that Democrats have lost the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate. Republicans now control almost two-thirds of the governors’ chairs throughout the country. And over the last nine years, Democrats have lost almost 1,000 legislative seats in states all across this country. Today—today, in almost half of the states in America, Democratic Party has almost no political presence at all. Now, if that’s not a failure, if that’s not a failed model, I don’t know what a failed model is.

I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be, violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs counter to our most deeply held American values.

Effect of the Sanders campaign on the Democratic party.
Many political experts say that Sanders' campaign made both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic party more progressive. After ending his presidential campaign, Sanders' ideas of national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage support, free college tuition and many of the other campaign platform issues have been becoming more popular. Some former staffers created the political action committee Brand New Congress which aimed at looking for younger people to run for office.
In the 2018 midterms, Sanders supported many progressive candidates. A few of the people he endorsed ended up winning their primaries. For example, in an upset that surprised many people, including the candidate herself, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat the incumbent Joseph Crowley for United States Representative in New York City. Benjamin Jealous became the Democratic nominee for Governor of Maryland. Ironworker Randy Bryce and former Chicago mayoral candidate Chuy García ran for United States Representative in Wisconsin and Illinois respectively, and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum won the Democratic party's nomination for Governor of Florida. Despite winning their primaries, only Ocasio-Cortez and García won their respective general elections.

= = = American Curl = = =
The American Curl is a breed of cat. It has unusual ears for a cat. They curl back away from the face and seem to be sideways. This cat is a rare breed, but now lives in the United States, Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and other parts of the world. The American Curl is usually a strong and healthy breed.
Both longhaired and shorthaired American Curls have soft, silky coats which lie flat against their bodies. They require little grooming and enjoy spending time with their owners.
Appearance.
The American Curl is a medium-sized cat (5–10 lbs). It is not completely grown until 2–3 years of age. American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, like any other kittens. The ears begin to curl in about eighty-two days. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer. Then they become hard and feel stiff.
A house pet American Curl may have almost straight ears. To qualify for cat shows, ears must curl at an angle between 90 and 180 degrees. More curl is better, but cats will be not allowed to be shown if their ears touch the back of their skulls.
History.
The breed began in Lakewood, California in a natural birth of kittens, but with a genetic mutation. In June 1981, two stray kittens were found and taken in by the Ruga family. The kittens were both longhaired, one black and the other black and white. The family named the black cat Shulamith. The black and white was named Panda. Several weeks later, Panda went missing. This left Shulamith to be the first female of the American Curl breed.
In 1986, an American Curl was judged in a cat show for the first time. In 1992, a longhaired American Curl became a champion in The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl was the first breed the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Championship Class allowed in both longhair and shorthair categories.

= = = Mercator projection = = =
The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection which is widely used in cartography today. It was developed by Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It is not a physical projection, and cannot be constructed using geometric tools. On a small scale, geometric shapes can be moved around the map, without distorting them (this property is known as conformity). As a downside, the scale of the shape and the direction of lines may change when shapes are moved. For example, Africa is actually 15 times larger than Greenland, but on this map projection they look the same size.
Today, Mercator projections are mainly used for maps.

Scagliola (from the Italian "scaglia", meaning "chips"), is an artificial way of imitating marble and other precious material. It is a decorative building material. 
Stucco columns, sculptures, and other architectural elements can be made by scagliola. It came into fashion in 17th-century Tuscany.
Scagliola is a composite substance made from selenite, glue and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. The material may be veined with colours and stuck on to a core, or patterns may be carved into a prepared scagliola matrix. The pattern is then then filled with the coloured, plaster-like composite. Then it is polished with flax oil for brightness, and wax for protection. The whole thing gives a richness of colour not easy to get in natural marbles.

= = = Puli = = =
The Puli is a small to medium sized dog breed. It was brought to Hungary with the Magyars in the late 9th century. They are used as herding and guard dogs.
Female Pulis are about high. Males are . Females weigh . Males weigh a little more.
Behavior.
The Puli is an intelligent and active dog. It needs obedience training while still young. If a Puli gets enough exercise it can live in the city, even in an apartment. 
But Pulis do best when not kept as indoor pets in a small living space. Pulis kept indoors need a lot of exercise to use up their energy, or they can became either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for. A Puli without enough exercise can became mischievous and cause trouble. The right kind of exercise includes running, biking, hiking, jogging and field work; not just a walk around the corner. Pulis are best kept in a house with a garden.
The Puli is happiest when it has work to do. Then this dog will show excellent intelligence, strength and ability to work with humans. This satisfies their strong instinct to guard their herd.
As a working dog, the Puli is obedient and focused when doing a task. Some of them are used as police dogs. They are one of the best sheepdogs. Pulis don't need to be taught how to guard the sheep. They naturally protect their territory and flock. Even though they are not big dogs, they will still try to scare away anyone they do not know.
If well trained, they understand even the smallest instructions and obey. They are excellent in obedience trials for dogs. These are also dogs who are sensitive (get their feelings hurt easily). Pulis hate being bullied or made fun of. Because they are so intelligent, they understand that they are being mistreated. If not treated well, they lose their desire to cooperate.
Pulis are not very friendly with people they do not know. With owners and friends, these dogs are funny, lovely and playful. Pulis bark quite a lot.
Fur.
The coat of fur on a Puli is corded, like dreadlocks. The puli is a one-colored dog. It is usually black. It can also be white, gray, or cream. All Pulis, even the white ones have black eyes, black noses and black feet. The Puli's coat needs a lot of care to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. About 45 minutes of grooming work each week is recommended. When the dog is older the cords can become quite long and heavy. They sometimes are so long that they touch the ground. The cords can be thinner or thicker cords. The thin, nice cords are made by keeping the fur clean and cared for. Thin ropes are made by hand forming thinner ropes. 
This breed has little to no shedding (see Moult).

= = = American Cocker Spaniel = = =
The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of dog. It is one of many Spaniel breeds. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel. In other parts of the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel. This is because there is a Cocker Spaniel called English Cocker Spaniel. They are clever, loving and happy dogs.
The breed.
The breed is the smallest of the sporting or hunting dogs. Also, there are some differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy and intelligent working breed. Because of having been bred to meet show dog qualities, it is no longer an ideal working dog. These Spaniels now have many health problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.
The American Cocker has a medium long silky coat of fur. It has an upturned nose, either black or brown. It has long, silky ears that hang down. The eyes are large, dark in color and round. Fur colors can be black, tan, cream, dark red, buff, roan and sometimes merle.
Behavior.
This dog breed is nicknamed the "Merry Cocker". It is a friendly dog and not shy.
It is smart as a hunting dog. IQ tests given in the 1950s and 1960s showed the American Cocker did best of all dogs tested on hunting skills. But, they did not do as well on other skills. These showed they were slower in uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string. The American Cocker Spaniel is in 20th place in Stanley Coren's "The Intelligence of Dogs". This means this dog is excellent in "Working or Obedience Intelligence" and in being trained.
If they are played with and loved as puppies, American Cockers can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed has a tail that wags most of the time. It likes best to be around people. It is not meant to be left alone in a backyard. Cockers can get stressed by loud noises and by being treated roughly or fussed at.
Because they have now been bred to have a long coat, they can no longer be active enough to hunt or be exercised outside.

= = = Knock Shrine = = =
Knock Shrine () is a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site. In 1879, a religious vision was said to have happened in the village of Knock, County Mayo, Ireland. It was seen by fifteen people. The vision was of The Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, John the Evangelist, angels, and Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God. A church was later built on the site, to worship and remember this event.
The vision.
On the evening of 21 August 1879, at about 8 o'clock, fifteen people, aged from five years to seventy-five included men, women, teenagers and children, witnessed this event.
They all said they saw an apparition of Our Lady, Saint Joseph, and Saint John the Evangelist on the wall of the small parish church. The little church was called the Church of Saint John the Baptist.

= = = Prime number theorem = = =
The prime number theorem is a theorem from number theory. Prime numbers are not distributed evenly across the number range. The theorem formalizes the idea that the probability of hitting a prime number between 1 and a given number becomes smaller, as numbers grow. This probability is about n/ln(n), where ln(n) is the natural logarithm function. This means that the probability of hitting a prime number with 2n digits is about half as likely than with n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (ln 101000 ≈ 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (ln 102000 ≈ 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first "N" integers is roughly ln("N").
Fifteen-year old Carl Friedrich Gauss suspected that there was a link between prime numbers and logarithms in 1793. Adrien-Marie Legendre also suspected such a link in 1798. Jacques Hadamard and Charles-Jean de La Vallée Poussin proved the prime number theorem in 1896, over a century after Gauss.

= = = Cat righting reflex = = =
The cat righting reflex is a cat's natural ability to turn itself around as it falls so it will land on its feet. This righting reflex starts to happen at 3–4 weeks of age. The cat has entirely learned how to do this by 6–7 weeks. Cats are able to do this because they have a flexible backbone and a clavicle that does not move. The minimum height needed for this to happen safely in most cats is about 12 inches.
Cats without a tail can also do this. This is because a cat mostly moves its hind legs and does not use much angular momentum to set itself up for landing. So a tail is not really needed for this skill.
Using this righting reflex, cats can often land without injury. But, this is not always true, since cats can still break bones or die from extreme falls. 
In a 1987 study, written in the "Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association", 132 cats were looked at after having fallen from buildings. The injuries per cat were more, depending on the height fallen; up to seven stories high. Above seven stories, the injuries were less. The study authors think that after falling five stories, the cats reached terminal velocity. At that time, the cats relaxed and spread their bodies to increase drag.
How the cat does it.
First, cats decide which is up or down, by looking to see or by using senses in the inner ear. Then, cats manage to twist themselves to face downward, without ever changing their angular momentum. They do this in these steps:
If the cat is not flexible enough (able to bend easily), it may need to do steps two and three again in order to completely right itself.
Terminal velocity.
Besides this righting reflex, cats have body features that help keep them safe in a fall. Their small size, light bones, and thick fur decrease their terminal velocity. Also, once righted they may also spread out their body to increase drag and slow how fast they are falling. They also relax as they fall, which protects them some when they land.

= = = Buttered cat paradox = = =
The buttered cat paradox is a popular joke based on putting two adages (sayings) together to make them funny:
The paradox happens when one asks this question: What would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height?
In reality.
In reality, cats can turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down. This is named the cat righting reflex. This reflex lets them land on their feet if dropped from high enough up (about ). Toast, not being alive, does not have the ability to turn itself over. Nor does it want to, since it cannot think.
Toast usually lands on the floor butter-side-down. This is because of how it is dropped from a table. As the toast falls from the table, it rotates or turns. Using the average speed of rotation for a slice of toast as it falls from the table and the usual height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor 81% of the time. This is because the buttered side is heavier. When an object has a heavy and light side, in most cases it will fall heavy side first.
Domestic cats usually weigh between . A regular slice of bread weighs only one ounce and a pat of butter about one fourth ounce. So attaching a very small piece of toast with butter to a much larger cat would hardly have any effect on how the cat would move.

= = = Louis Philippe I = = =
Louis Philippe I (6 October 1773 — 26 August 1850) nicknamed the Citizen King (French: "le Roi Citoyen") was King of the French from 1830 until he was forced to abdicate following the French Revolution in 1848. As Louis Philippe III, he was also the Duke of Orléans from 1793 to 1830 where he passed that title to his son, Philippe which became the title of the heirs to the French throne rather than going back to the traditional, Dauphin of France.
Throughout his reign, Louis brought peace, stability, and prosperity to France. He started France's colonialism over the world. He conquered Algeria and Tunisia which increased France's territory, army, and navy. He also ordered the completion of the Arc de Triomphe. This increased his popularity.
However, in 1848, his popularity declined because he opposed parlimentarism and that he always wanted to rule as an absolute monarch. He also started to support the rich people and care less about the poor. This broke off the French Revolution of 1848. Since there were already two major revolutions and that Louis did not want another French Revolution, he abdicated the throne and fled the country. He travelled to the UK and moved into the Claremont House in Surrey and lived there under the name "Mr Smith" until his death due to dysentery on 26 October 1850 at the age of 77.
He started France's colonialism in Africa and North America. His conquest of Algeria, Tunisia, and North America greatly made France more powerful.
Louis had some of the qualities of being a good king. He greatly expanded France. He also made France more modern. He built the Arc de Triomphe, the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde and the July Column in the Place de la Bastille.
Early life.
Born at the Palais Royal in Paris he was named Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Louis Philippe in honour of his father. His parents were the Duke and Duchess of Orléans. One of the most senior members of the French royal court. He was born a Prince of the blood which entitled him to be addressed as "His Serene Highness". From birth he was given the title of Duke of Valois one of his fathers subsidiary titles. He was the eldest of four children born to the duke and duchess. He was a member of the House of Orléans, itself a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon. The two branches were both directly descended from Louis XIV and were often in competition with one another. 
His education was carried out by Madame de Genlis who was later his fathers mistress. It was she who instilled a fairly liberal attitude within the young prince. When Louis Philippe's grandfather died in 1785, his father succeeded him as Duke of Orléans and Louis Philippe succeeded his father as Duke of Chartres.
His parents had a strained marriage the Duke was famous for his many extramarital affairs and his wife just quietly accepted his infidelity. She was a notoriously religious woman who relished watching her children grow up. Louis Philippe was the eldest of four children born to the couple. Louis Philippe was very close to his brother, the younger Duke of Montpensier. 
In 1792 he joined the French army and went to fight in Austria. But in April 1793 he deserted. He could not return to France so he found work as a teacher in Switzerland. He then went to live in Sweden. After that he lived in the United States and finally he moved to England.
After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Louis Philippe returned to France. King Louis XVIII gave him back his Orléans estates.
Marriage.
In 1808, proposed to Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George III of the United Kingdom. His Catholicism and the opposition of her mother Queen Charlotte meant the princess reluctantly declined the offer.
In 1809, Louis Philippe married Princess Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Maria Carolina of Austria. They had ten children. Maria Amalia was also a niece of the late Queen Marie Antoinette.
He died on August 26, 1850 in Claremont, Surrey, England.

= = = Stanley Motor Carriage Company = = =
The Stanley Motor Carriage Company was an American manufacturer of steam-engine cars. The company was founded in 1898 and incorporated in 1901. The cars made by the company were called Stanley Steamers. They were produced from 1896 to 1924. In the early 1900s steam was used to power locomotives, steamships, even sewing machines. It seemed natural that steam could power cars. Of all the steam driven cars made in the early 20th century, the Stanley Steamer was the best-known and most popular. Today Stanley Steamers are rare automobiles and hard to find outside of museums and a few car collections.
Early history.
Twins Francis E. Stanley and Freelan O. Stanley were the co-inventors of the Stanley Steamer automobile. Freelan was a teacher and high school principal. Francis was also a teacher, but left teaching in 1874 to become a photographer. In 1885 they both left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The brothers had become interested in making cars and wanted to do that full time.
Building steam cars.
Many inventors were working on making cars during this time. The Stanley brothers built their first two cars as a hobby. In 1898 they brought their cars to the first Auto show in the US held in Boston. Cars from the US and Europe were on exhibition. There was also an outdoor competition. Their Stanley Steamers were faster and could climb hills much better than other cars. No gasoline engined car could climb the 15% grade. A Whitney steam car nearly climbed the 20% grade. The Stanley steamer easily climbed the 30% grade.
With the money from the sale of their company to Eastman Kodak, they began making steam cars. In 1899, they produced and sold over 200 cars, more than any other U.S. maker. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road; the descent was accomplished by putting the engine in low gear and using the car's brakes. The twins later sold the rights to this early design to Locomobile, and in 1902 they formed the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.
Stanley licensed their designs to several other motor car companies. The White Motor Company was one who used the Stanley design and continued to produce steam cars until 1912. Stanley was the last manufacturer of steam powered cars. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. The numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. Francis Stanley died in an automobile accident later the same year (1918). His brother Freelan opened a hotel in Colorado called The Stanley Hotel. He lived to be 91 years old. Stanley Steamers were made until 1924.
Design and operation.
Early Stanley cars had bodies made of wood. The bodies were attached to steel frames by leaf springs. Later bodies were made of aluminum. A Kerosene burner heated a drum-shaped boiler. The boiler stored steam. The driver controlled the steam going to the engine by a throttle. There was no need for a transmission. Starting a Stanley in the morning would wake everyone who lived nearby. It sounded like a steam locomotive, hissing and chugging. It was very hard to steal a Stanley Steamer. It took 20 minutes to gather enough steam before it could move. Once it was moving it seemed to have unlimited power. An early Stanley Steamer was capable of 75 miles per hour. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour in Florida. To operate a Stanley Steamer, the driver had to watch a number of gauges. There were 13 handles, pumps and valves to adjust. They carried only a small amount of water due to its weight. The car could only go about 40 miles before it had to add water. The kerosene burner was known to cause fires. The easier to operate gasoline powered internal combustion engine caused the steam car to become obsolete.

= = = Voice-tracking = = =
Voice-tracking is a technique used by some radio stations in radio broadcasting to make an illusion of a live disc jockey or announcer sitting in the studios of the radio station when one is actually not in the station.
Background.
Voice-tracking refers to the process of a disc jockey prerecording the parts when they speak on the radio. It is then mixed with songs, commercials and other elements to make it sound like a live air shift. Voice-tracking is mostly used in radio stations, especially during the night, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. Most radio stations also use it as a way to save money instead of having disc jockeys around the clock.
Variations.
Sometimes, voice-tracking is done so that people can do other jobs. For example, a DJ may also have a job as a program director or general manager. Voice-tracking allows that person to record a three-hour shift in less than a half-hour, leaving him or her time to do office work. A popular live weekday morning radio host can record parts for a Saturday show, allowing him or her to be on the air six days a week without spending more time at the station. It is also helpful during holidays such as Christmas or Easter, when people are off spending time with their families.
Formatics.
Different radio stations want their DJs to speak only at certain times. Here is an example:
As an example, see the picture below:&lt;br&gt;
As one song ends, the next song begins. At this point, the DJ doesn't start talking until the second song starts and he stops at the point where the song's vocals start.

The show also stars Joey Bragg, Tenzing Norgay Trainor, Kali Rocha, and Benjamin King. The characters they play are Joey Rooney, Parker Rooney, Karen Rooney, and Pete Rooney.

Plot.
After finishing a four-year stint in Hollywood filming a popular television show called "Sing It Loud!", actress Liv Rooney returns to her birthplace of Stevens Point, Wisconsin to the open arms of her family, despite being offered more roles in other shows and movies. Liv decided to come home because she missed her family and wanted to see them again. She is happily reunited with her identical twin sister Maddie. Maddie is her best friend. Liv is a girly girl. She enjoys anytime someone mentions her former career. Maddie is a tomboy with a talent for basketball. She is the captain of her school's basketball team. The twins have two younger brothers. They are Joey and Parker. Joey is a typical awkward teen. He is one year younger than the twins. Parker is a clever tween. He has a mischievous personality.

In the first three seasons, most events take place at either Ridgewood High, the high school that Liv, Maddie, Joey, and later Parker, due to being a child prodigy, all attend, or the Rooney residence. At the end of the third season, the Rooney house collapses due to a series of tunnels created by Parker and Maddie is accepted into a college in Los Angeles, California. This prompts the rest of the Rooneys, except Pete who remains in Wisconsin to continue his coaching job, to move to Malibu, California, to take up residence with Karen's younger sister Dena and her daughter Ruby, where the show's forth season takes place. In the last episode of the series, all the Rooneys part ways.

A big part of the show are documentary-style cutaways where major characters and the supporting characters talk to the viewers to explain various things and their opinions on the situations in which they are featured in each episode. In the last episode, it is revealed that the cutaways are part of a reality series that airs in Luxembourg called "Bits and Pieces". This is a reference to the working title of "Liv and Maddie".
Series overview.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt; &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Production.
Development.
In the spring of 2012, Oops Doughnuts Productions had shopped the script of a project called "Bits and Pieces". It was about a blended family similar to shows like "The Brady Bunch" and "Step by Step". The show followed Jodie Sullenger (Kali Rocha), mother of Alanna (Dove Cameron) and Sticky (Joey Bragg). Sullenger married Pete Fickman (Benjamin King), father of Crystal (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and Brody (Tenzing Norgay Trainor). All six have to get used to life under the same roof. Eventually, Disney chose to change the concept of "Bits and Pieces" into one about a pair of twins. Now titled "Liv and Maddie", the show began production in April 2013.
The show was produced under a joint venture between Beck &amp; Hart Productions, Oops Doughnuts Productions, and It's a Laugh Productions. The show's creators, John D. Beck and Ron Hart, are a production-writing team. Their credits include "According to Jim", "Hey Arnold!", and "Shake It Up!". They also served as executive producers alongside Andy Fickman. Fickman was the only director who participated in all four seasons of the show. He directed 20 of the 21 episodes of the first season.

= = = Black box = = =
A black box, in science and engineering, is a box whose inside working is not known.
It is a device, system or object with input and output. There is no knowledge of its internal workings. The way it works is "opaque" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, or the human brain.
Ashby expains that the term arose when a decision had to be made about opening an engineering box. The question was whether to return the box for repair, or just scrap it. Could this be decided without opening the box? There can be many reasons why a complex system cannot be repaired in the field, and even opening up some systems is a big deal. The question also comes up in surgery on brain damage patients. The more that can be discovered before operating, the better.p86
The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic can be seen. It is sometimes known as a clear box, a glass box, or a white box.

= = = Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans = = =
Prince Ferdinand Philippe of Orléans, Duke of Orléans (Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Henri Joseph; 3 September 1810 – 13 July 1842) was the eldest son of Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans and future King Louis Philippe I. Born in exile in his mother's native Sicily, he was their heir to the House of Orléans from birth. Following his father's succession as King of the French in 1830, he became the "Prince Royal" and subsequently Duke of Orléans (French: "duc d'Orléans"), the title by which he is best known. Dying in 1842, he never succeeded his father nor saw the collapse of the "July Monarchy" and subsequent exile of his family to England.
Infancy and background.
He was named after his two grandfathers King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Philippe Égalité. He was born in Palermo and given the title of Duke of Chartres. He was also a prince of the blood at the French royal court of Versailles. This gave him the style of "Serene Highness". His father was banned from attending court at Versailles due to his liberal views. Prince did not attend either. He instead remained at his father's court at their Parisian residence the Palais Royal. 
Heir to the throne.
His father became King of the French in 1830. This made the prince the heir to the title of Duke of Orléans and heir to the throne. From that time the heir to the French throne was to be known as the Duke of Orléans. His father also declared his descendants through the male line were entitled to use the style of "Royal Highness". They also used the title (a title in its own right) of Prince of Orléans. The prince became known as His Royal Highness, Prince Ferdinand Philippe of Orléans, Duke of Orléans. His sons were also entitled to the same style and title.
Marriage.
There were plans for him to marry his cousin, Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois. But the plans never materialised. There were also negotiations for the young prince to marry an Austrian Archduchess as well as a Russian grand duchess. But the plans again never materialised as the new monarchy in France was seen as fragile and not expected to survive. Instead the choice came in the form of Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She was a member of a minor ducal family native to Germany. The couple eventually married on 30 May 1837. This gave her the style of Royal Highness and made her one of the first princesses of Orléans by marriage. The couple eventually had two sons and had a very happy marriage.

= = = Superposition principle = = =
In physics, the superposition principle states that if there are two or more stimuli at a given point in time, the response will be the result of adding all the responses. This only applies to linear systems. Since many systems can be modelled as linear systems, the principle has many applications in physics and engineering.
Superposition principle: The principle states that the total force on a given charge is the vector of the individual forces exerted on the given charge by all other charges. Each individual force between any two charges is calculated from Coulomb's law tattoos and is not affected by the presence of other charges

= = = Interdisciplinarity = = =
Interdisciplinarity is when two or more subjects (academic disciplines) join up. This happens when a problem overlaps traditional academic boundaries. Other terms which mean almost the same thing are multidisciplinarity and crossdisciplinarity.
An examples makes clear what is meant:
Other examples include artificial intelligence, cultural studies, cybernetics, computational linguistics, biomedical engineering, and so on. Physical chemistry, biochemistry and astrophysics must have been some of the first.
In many universities, traditional departments (e.g. botany, zoology) were scrapped, and new broader departments like 'School of biological sciences' were formed. Inside this umbrella, research and teaching teams were based on interdisciplinary problems, such as ecology or cell division or Earth history. There are some necessary specialities which do not fit easily into the new system. Examples are taxonomy (you still need people to identify animals) and areas like parasitology and agricultural botany. 
A system which works in some universities is to appoint staff to the Schools (usually Humanities, Science. Social sciences and Technology) and let the staff join those groups which best fit their expertise.

Every year the alewife and blueback herring swim upstream from their adult home in the sea. this is to spawn in the fresh water where they came from.
The first settlement of Watertown was at the Saltonstall Plantation in 1630. This was one of the earliest of the Massachusetts Bay settlements. It was begun by a group of settlers led by Richard Saltonstall and the Rev. George Phillips. It was officially incorporated that same year. The alternate spelling "Waterton" is seen in some early documents.

= = = Battering ram = = =
A battering ram is a siege engine used in the past. It was used to break open the stone walls of castles or splinter their wooden gates.
In its simplest form, a battering ram is just a large, heavy log carried by several people and banged against an obstacle. The ram damages the target if the big log hit the target again and again. Later rams were covered in the log with an arrow-proof, fire-resistant canopy mounted on wheels. Inside the canopy, the log was swung from chains or ropes.
Rams were great weapons of war against old fashioned wall-building materials such as stone and brick. These walls were weak in tension: they cracked when struck with sufficient force. With many blows, the cracks would grow steadily until a hole was created. Eventually, a breach would appear in the fabric of the wall. It would cause armed attackers to force their way through the gap.
The introduction in the later Middle Ages (around 1400s) of siege cannons causes the end of battering rams and other traditional siege weapons. Much smaller, hand-held versions of battering rams are still used today, however, by law enforcement officers and military personnel to bash open locked doors.

= = = Zugzwang = = =
Zugzwang is a chess term. It means a situation where any move by a player will weaken the player's position. The fact that the player is compelled to move means that their position will become significantly weaker.
For example...
1. ... Kd7 and White cannot win:
2. c6+ Kc7
3. Kc5 Kc8
4. Kd6 Kd8 (opposing the king)
5. c7+ Kc8
6. Kc6 is stalemate
But if it is White to play in the original position, he can win by zugzwang:
1. Kc6! and now Black must move his king, for example
1... Kd8
3. Kb7 and queens the pawn.
Mutual zugzwang.
There are positions where either player to move will lose.
On the following diagram, Whichever king moves, he loses his pawn and the opponent will win the game.
History.
The concept of zugzwang was known in the old forms of chess, like shatranj. We know this because there are some Arabic chess problems which use the idea.
The term itself comes from the 19th century in a German chess magazine. Its first use in English was in the early 20th century.

= = = Zwischenzug = = =
In chess, zwischenzug (German for "intermediate move") is a common tactic that occurs in almost every game: instead of countering a direct threat, which the opponent expects, a move is played which poses an even more devastating threat, often an attack against the queen or the king. The opponent has to counter that threat first, and this will ideally change the situation to his disadvantage.
Borisenkov-Mezenev (diagram, Black to play), went 1... f2, threatening to queen, which White countered with 2. Rg8, intending 3. Rf8+. But White resigned after the zwischenzug 2... Bb1! which allows Black to queen (3. Kb1 f1Q+ or 3. Rf8+ Bf5).

The Dean comes forward on the House Floor to administer (give) the oath to the Speaker-elect. The new Speaker then administers the oath to the other members. The Dean does not preside over the election of the Speaker, unlike the Father of the House in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and the Dean of the Canadian House of Commons.
Because of other privileges associated with seniority, the Dean is usually given some of the most desirable office space. The Dean is generally either chair or ranking minority member of an influential committee. Unlike the office of President pro tem, the Dean of the House of Representatives is not an official position.

= = = Francis Edgar Stanley = = =
Francis Edgar Stanley (1849 – 1918), was an American inventor, photographer and manufacturer. He and his twin brother Freelan Oscar Stanley invented and manufactured the Stanley Steamer car. They were pioneers in the use of steam engines to power cars.
Early life.
Francis E. Stanley and his twin Freelan O. Stanley were born on 1 June 1849 in Kingsfield, Maine. Their parents were Solomon and Apphia (French) Stanley. Solomon Stanley was both a farmer and a teacher. He and his brother graduated from Farmington State Normal School in Farmington, Maine. The school is now the University of Maine at Farmington. Francis became a teacher, and taught at New Portland, Cape Elizabeth and Strong, Maine. In 1870 he met and married Augusta May Walker, another teacher. Together they had three children. In 1875 he left teaching and moved to Auburn, Maine. He became an artist and photographer opening a studio there. He began to do more portrait photography and opened two more studios in Lewiston and Bridgton, Maine. In the early 1880s he started experimenting with the new dry plate way of taking pictures.
In 1885 both brothers left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The photographic plate business had made both brothers very wealthy.
The Stanley Steamer.
In 1897 the two brothers began experimenting and making steam-powered cars. They were soon making about 200 cars a year. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown and began building their cars. They then sold their car company to John B. Walker and Amzi L. Barber for $250,000 USD. With it they sold the rights to their car designs. The sale had a clause that the two Stanley brothers could not build and sell cars for two years. The Stanley brothers broke the clause and had to give their new design to the company Walker and Barber formed, the Locomobile Company of America. In 1901 Francis and Freelan Stanley formed a new car company, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.
The cars they produced, called Stanley Steamers, had many advantages. The cost was $650. That was $300 less than the cost of a Ford Model T. The cars were very quiet and only made hissing sounds from the boiler. They had no transmission because there was no need to change gears as there was with gasoline-powered cars. Their cars began making news. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour on a beach in Florida.
Later years.
As other car companies moved from steam to gasoline power, the Stanley Steamer became the most popular steam powered car. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, however, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. Finally, the numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. both brothers retired. A few months later, while he was driving home from a trip to Maine, his car ran off the road. He was driving a new 1918 Model 735 Stanley Steamer. He died in the accident, July 21, 1918. He was 69 years old. His brother Freelan lived to be 91 years old.

= = = MIPS architecture = = =
The MIPS architecture is an instruction set for computers that was developed at Stanford University in 1981. At the start, MIPS was an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. Most of it is done in RISC. In a full RISC architecture, all commands have the same length. This simplifies the design of the microchip and allows to use fast clock cycles. At the start, the architecture used a 32 bit bus, but from 1991, a 64 bit architecture was used.
In 2015, MIPS implementations are primarily used in embedded systems such as Windows CE devices, routers, residential gateways, and video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Until late 2006, they were also used in many of SGI's computer products. MIPS implementations were also used by Digital Equipment Corporation, NEC, Pyramid Technology, Siemens Nixdorf, Tandem Computers and others during the late 1980s and 1990s. In the mid to late 1990s, it was estimated that one in three RISC microprocessors produced was a MIPS implementation.

= = = Freelan Oscar Stanley = = =
Freelan Oscar Stanley (1849 – 1940), was an American educator, inventor and manufacturer. He left teaching to join his twin brother Francis Edgar Stanley in the photographic dry plate business. After selling the business, the two brothers invented and manufactured the Stanley Steamer car. They were pioneers in the use of steam engines to power cars.
Early life.
Freelan O. Stanley and his twin brother Francis E. Stanley were born on 1 June 1849 in Kingsfield, Maine. Their parents were Solomon and Apphia (French) Stanley. Solomon Stanley was both a farmer and a teacher. Freelan and his brother Francis graduated from Farmington State Normal School in Farmington, Maine. The school is now the University of Maine at Farmington. Freelan became a teacher and taught at Andover, Lisbon and Farmington, Maine. He later became principal of the high school at Mechanic Falls, Maine. In 1876 he met and married Flora Tileston.
In 1885 he and his twin brother left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The photographic plate business had made both brothers very wealthy.
The Stanley Steamer.
In 1896 Freelan and his brother Francis visited the Brockton County Fair. They saw a steam car and decided to build one themselves. In 1897 the two brothers began making steam-powered cars. Their steam cars had a much lighter boiler and a lighter steam engine than the rest. They were soon making about 200 cars a year. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown and began building their cars. They then sold their car company to John B. Walker and Amzi L. Barber for $250,000 USD. With it they sold the rights to their car designs. The sale had a clause that the two Stanley brothers could not build and sell cars for two years. The Stanley brothers broke the clause and had to give their new design to the company Walker and Barber formed, the Locomobile Company of America. In 1901 Francis and Freelan Stanley formed a new car company, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.
The cars they produced, called Stanley Steamers, had many advantages. The cost was $650. That was $300 less than the cost of a Ford Model T. The cars were very quiet and only made hissing sounds from the boiler. They had no transmission because there was no need to change gears as there was with gasoline-powered cars. Their cars began making news. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour on a beach in Florida.
Later years.
In business, the twins looked exactly alike and dressed the same. They even trimmed their beards the same. People they worked with said the only way to tell them apart was each had a different reaction when you told him a joke. As other car companies moved from steam to gasoline power, their Stanley Steamer became the most popular steam powered car. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, however, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. Finally, the numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. both brothers retired. A few months later, while he was driving home from a trip to Maine, Francis' car ran off the road. Francis was driving a new 1918 Model 735 Stanley Steamer. He died in the accident, July 21, 1918.
In 1903 Freelan came down with tuberculosis and was given less than a year to live. He and his wife Flora came to Colorado to try to improve his health. The couple fell in love with Estes Park, Colorado. Stanley's health began to improve and in 1906 he began building a large hotel. The site had spectacular views of Rocky Mountain National Park. He opened his hotel in 1909. It had luxuries (for that time) of telephones, electricity and indoor plumbing. He had a fleet of Stanley Steamers to bring guests to his hotel, named The Stanley Hotel. The Stanley Hotel was the inspiration behind Stephen King's book "The Shining". King wrote much of the book while he was a guest in room 217. Other famous guests of the hotel include Theodore Roosevelt, Molly Brown and the Emperor of Japan.
Stanley made a number of contributions to Estes Park. He built a hydroelectric plant to provide electricity to the town. He gave land for parks, a fairground and he improved roads in the area. He spent every summer in Estes Park for 37 years. He died on October 2, 1940 at age 91.

= = = Kodak = = =
Eastman Kodak Company was started by George Eastman and Henry A. Strong in 1881. They made their headquarters in Rochester, New York. It began as the Eastman Dry plate company. The company made Photographic plates for Photographers. It changed from a partnership to a corporation in 1884. In 1888 it changed its name again to the Eastman Kodak Company. This is when they released their first hand-held camera called the Kodak. It used a roll of photographic film which the company had started making in 1885. It was a camera simple enough for anyone to take pictures. Eastman Kodak re-invented photography and became an American success story. But their success would not last.
History.
At first photographers used glass plates they had to coat with an emulsion. But they had to be used within minutes of being coated. They also had to be processed into a picture right away. In 1878, Eastman successfully created dry plates that could be coated with a gelatin solution. These could be used at the photographer's convenience. They did not require all the heavy equipment wet plates did. Eastman decided to go into business selling them. He invented a machine to mass-produce dry plates. In 1888, the company sold the first Kodak box cameras. The slogan was "you press the button, we do the rest". For $24 USD the camera came already loaded with film capable of taking 100 pictures. The camera was sent back to the factory where for $10 the film was developed into pictures. These cameras first used paper film but later turned to Nitrocellulose film. An indexing roller to hold film was invented by David Houston. It had square holes in the edge of the film to advance the film with no waste or Multiple exposures. But Eastman did not want to pay to license his patent. So they bought his patent in 1899. Kodak kept making dry plates until that market dried up. Their main profit was in film and film developing papers and chemicals. They made film for the movie industry, 16mm film for hobby filmmaking and cameras of all kinds. In the mid- 1920s they came out with color film. In 1929 Kodak created motion picture film for adding sound to motion pictures.
Problems.
In 1947 Edwin H. Land invented the Polaroid instant camera. The camera could develop its own pictures inside the camera in 60 seconds. Within five years Polaroid sold over a million cameras. Kodak took notice. Since Kodak held 80% of the market for photographic development, instant cameras were a real threat. Kodak quickly came out with their own instant camera. Land sued Kodak for $12 billion for using its technology. In 1990 Land won and Kodak quit making instant cameras. But they won only a fraction of what they said Kodak's action had cost them, and Land went out of business in 2001.
Fujifilm, the Japanese photography company, began selling inexpensive film in the United States in the 1980s. Since their film cost much less than Kodak's, by 1999 they had a large share of the film market. Kodak lost millions of dollars and had many layoffs. When Digital cameras became popular, Kodak quickly joined that market. By 1999 they were the second largest maker of digital cameras. But they lost $60 on each one they sold.
Kodak made so many marketing mistakes that its stock dropped from $76 a share in 1999 to $25 in 2004. They dropped out of the film manufacturing business. Finally Kodak was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 2012 the 131-year-company filed for bankruptcy. After selling off many of its products to other companies, Kodak came out of bankruptcy a much smaller company.

= = = Off-site data protection = = =
In computing, off-site data protection, or vaulting, is the strategy of sending critical data off the main site. The place where the data is stored is often called the data vault.
In many organisations, there is some data which is so important that it must be protected. Protection against hacking can be done by means of software, but protection against physical damage is a different problem. The solution is to put the data in more than one place, so a major disaster, (such as fire or explosions) does not prevent the recovery of the computer system with all its most important data.
Data is usually taken off-site using media such as magnetic tape or optical storage. Data can also be sent electronically to a remote backup service, which is called "electronic vaulting" or "e-vaulting".
Sending backups off-site makes sure systems and servers can be reloaded with the latest data in the event of a disaster, accidental error, or system crash. Sending backups off-site also ensures there is a copy of data that is not stored on-site. Off-site backup services are convenient for companies that backup data on a daily basis (classified and unclassified).
Although some organizations manage and store their own off-site backups, many choose to have their backups managed and stored by others who specialize in the protection of off-site data.

= = = Integrated development environment = = =
An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a computer program that makes it easier to write other computer programs. They are used by computer programmers to edit source code, and can be easier to use than other text editors for new programmers. They can have compilers so programmers don't have to open other programs to compile the source code. They also often have syntax highlighting. A feature of an IDE is to check the syntax, and libraries can be added to increase functionality. It also may have predictive coding that can finish lines with syntax such as brackets or semicolons and can suggest variables to be used. It also may have debuggers that can step through lines, take breaks and inspect variables.
An IDE often comes with an interpreter and a compiler. Certain IDEs can allow multi-language which means that functions can be written in different languages.

= = = Syntax highlighting = = =
Syntax highlighting is where a text editor, integrated development environment or other computer program shows different parts of some source code in different colours. This makes it easier for computer programmers to read the source code and understand what it does. It can be done in different colors, and different programming languages have different rules about what parts of the source code need to be different colors.
Example.
This is an example comparing some C code without syntax highlighting and with syntax highlighting:

= = = Graph (mathematics) = = =
In mathematics, a graph is used to show how things are connected. The mathematical study on graph is called graph theory. The things being connected are called vertices, and the connections among them are called edges. If vertices are connected by an edge, they are called adjacent. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it. A graph's size formula_1is the number of edges in total. The number of vertices, written as formula_2, is called the order of a graph. 
Edges may have weights, which show the costs associated with using each edge. In a graph of cities on a map, the cost may be the distance between two cities, or the amount of time it takes to travel between the two.
Directed graphs go in one direction, like water flowing through a bunch of pipes. Undirected graphs don't have a direction, like a mutual friendship. A graph where there is more than one edge between two vertices is called multigraph. One where there is at most one edge is called a simple graph. A simple graph, where every vertex is directly connected to every other is called complete graph. A loop is an edge that connects to its own vertex. Loops are only allowed in multigraphs.
A sequence of edges is called a path. A path which starts and ends at the same edge is called a cycle.

Tabby cat, also known as grey tiger, or simply tabby is the name for domestic cats with fur coats of stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns. These cats often have a mark that looks like the letter "M" on their foreheads. Tabbies are not a cat breed. Tabby cats are very common. About two-thirds of the world's cat population are tabbies.
The tabby pattern is in many pure breeds of cats, as well as in mixed breeds. The tabby pattern happens naturally because of cats' closest ancestor, the African Wildcat. It has the same colors and patterns. 
Tabby patterns.
There are four tabby patterns that are genetically different: mackerel, classic, spotted, and ticked.
There is also a fifth pattern that includes tabby as part of another basic color pattern. The "patched" tabby is a calico or tortoiseshell cat with tabby patches (also known as "caliby" and "torbie").
Mackerel is the original pattern and is by far the most common tabby pattern. The legs and tail have dark bars as do the cat's cheeks. A "mackerel tabby" has narrow stripes that run in parallel down its sides. This is what some people refer to as a "tiger." An "M" shape appears on the forehead along with dark lines across the cat's cheeks to the corners of its eyes. Mackerels are also called 'Fishbone tabbies' probably because of the mackerel fish. A mackerel tabby pattern is the only striped coat pattern seen in domestic cats.
The classic tabby cat (also known as "blotched" or "marbled") has a pattern usually in the colors of dark brown, ochre, and black; but sometimes grey. Classic tabbies have the "M" pattern on their foreheads too. The body is marked with a whirled or swirled pattern (often called a "bullseye") on the cat's sides. There is also a light colored "butterfly" pattern on the shoulders and three thin stripes (the center stripe is dark) running along its spine. Classic tabbies have dark stripes on their legs, tail, and cheeks. Classic tabby is a recessive trait, so these cats are not as common as mackerel tabbies.
A ticked tabby pattern makes a grizzly color of fur of dark and light bands or bars. These break up the tabby pattern into a "salt-and-pepper" look. Some stripes or bars can often be seen on the lower legs, face and belly and sometimes at the end of the cat's tail.
The spotted tabby has a gene that breaks up the mackerel tabby pattern so that the stripes appear as spots. Sometimes, the stripes of a classic tabby's pattern may be broken into larger spots. Both large spot and small spot patterns can be seen in the Australian Mist, Bengal, Egyptian Mau, Maine Coon, and Ocicat breeds.
Colors.
Tabbies may be brown, grey, orange, or calico, including dilute versions of these colors. The most common tabby color is brown. All orange cats are tabbies, and the orange portion of calico cats will always show tabby patterns. Since the orange gene is on the X chromosome, about 80% of orange tabby cats are male, and nearly all calico cats are female. Colorpoint cats (Siamese, Himalayan, etc) that are tabbies are referred to as lynx point. As with solid-color cats, tabbies may also be partly white, such as tuxedo or van patterns. The tabby pattern is not visible at all in the white portion.
History.
The mackerel tabby pattern was the first tabby pattern in domestic cats. It is believed to have come from the African Wildcat and the European Wildcat. Both of these wild cats have a pale, striped tabby pattern. But when those breeds mixed, it made a more distinct mackerel tabby coat. At first, the mackerel tabby was common in all domestic cats. But later, other tabby patterns happened because of mutations and selective breeding of the mackerel tabby. All domestic cats have the tabby gene. But the genes of some cat breeds hide the tabby appearance.

Melvin Ellis Calvin (April 8, 1911 – January 8, 1997) was an American chemist. He discovered the Calvin cycle (with Andrew Benson and James Bassham). He was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Calvin spent most of his five-decade career at the University of California, Berkeley.
Using the carbon-14 isotope as a tracer, Calvin and colleagues mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis. It starts with its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide, and ends with its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds.
They showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds. Calvin was the sole recipient of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. He wrote an autobiography three decades later titled "Following the trail of light: a scientific odyssey".
During the 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research. In 1963 he was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology.

= = = Welsh Parliament = = =
The Welsh Parliament (), commonly shortened to Senedd, is the devolved parliament with the power to make devolved laws in Wales. Between 1999 and 2020, it had the name National Assembly for Wales; commonly shortened to Welsh Assembly.

The Assembly was created after the "Government of Wales Act 1998" law, which was introduced after a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to make "primary legislation" until the "Government of Wales Act 2006" law, which gave the Assembly limited powers to make laws.
Its powers were increased again after a Yes vote in a referendum on 3 March 2011, which allowed the Assembly to make laws without having to make a request to the Parliament of the UK, or to the Secretary of State for Wales.

The Senedd has 60 members, called Members of the Senedd, or MSs for short. In Welsh, they are called "Aelod o'r Senedd".
Members of the Senedd are elected for 4 years in an "additional members system - "40 AMs are elected by the "plurality system, "and represent the different areas of Wales. Another 20 AMs from 5 electoral regions are also elected, by the "proportional representation system."

= = = Dry plate = = =
Dry plate, also known as gelatin process, is an improved type of photographic plate. It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871. By 1879 the first dry plate factory had been established. With much of the complex chemical work done at the factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers. 
History.
The first practical way to take photographs was called the daguerreotype. It was introduced in 1839. It used sheets of copper coated with silver. The plate was then exposed to chemical fumes, then taken to the camera. Introduced in the 1850s the Collodion process was introduced. It used what were called wet plates. But a wet plate had to be prepared and used within minutes. It also had a very slow photographic speed. The preparation of wet plates required numerous chemicals. These had to be mixed in the dark in a portable tent if the photographer was planning on photographing away from the studio. In the 1880s the gelatin dry plate replaced the wet plates. The dry plate allowed much faster exposure times. Now a moving subject could be captured on film. The dry plates could be manufactured in a factory and used whenever the photographer wanted.

= = = Dogs in Space = = =
Dogs in Space is a 1986 Australian drama movie about Melbourne's little band scene in 1978. It was directed by Richard Lowenstein. It starred Michael Hutchence as Sam, a drugged dazed singer of a band named Dogs in Space.
The story was from Lowenstein's personal experience of living in a shared house in Melbourne in the late 1970s. Lowenstein had already worked with Michael Hutchence making rock videos. He also produced video clips for songs from the INXS album "The Swing". He wrote the lead role of Sam with Michael Hutchence in mind.
The character Sam is about a real member of a punk rock band that Lowenstein had lived with in the 1970s. The house in the movie was the one they had shared. It was rented from its new owners and changed back to its original condition for the movie. The cost for the deconstruction of the house was part of the movie's budget.
Copies of "Dogs in Space" are being preserved by the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra. This means the movie will be protected from damage that happens to older film that was used to make movies.
Plot.
A group of young music fans share a house in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond. It is not too far away from the city to be an active part of the music scene. Sam and Tim are members of a band named Dogs in Space. They share the house with a group of social misfits and quite troubled young people. These include Sam's girlfriend Anna and a really smart university student, Luchio. He is actually trying to study for exams even in the confusion of the house. There is also a nameless teenager, who is just called The Girl. She comes and goes; sometimes sleeping over.
The scenes cover the day-to-day lives of the characters, mainly the sexual relationship between Sam and Anna. There are many party scenes with live music and drug use. During quiet times, the housemates move the television outdoors into the street to watch it on sofas and eat junk food and drink beer. The group makes frequent trips to a convenience store to restock.
Footage of Sputnik 2 is intermittently seen in the movie (in tribute to the title: "Dogs in Space"). The footage mostly shows Laika, the first Soviet Union dog in space. These scenes can also be seen in the background when the television is playing. There are trips to many local pubs for live punk music. In the end, the group's dangerous lifestyle costs a life of a loved one. Anna dies from a heroin overdose.
Soundtrack album.
There was a punk rock soundtrack album released with the following songs and artists. The album and the later CD are both out of print. Rare copies sell well and fetch the asking price.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) is a 1987 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was signed in Washington, D.C. by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev on December 8, 1987.
It was ratified by the United States Senate on May 27, 1988 and came into force on June 1 of that year. The treaty is formally titled The Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.
The treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with intermediate ranges of 500-5,500 km (300-3,400 miles).
In 2012 the United States complained about Russian treaty violations. The two systems that appear to be violations are the R-500, a cruise missile using the 9K720 Iskander launcher, and a short ranged ICBM. 
In July 2014, the United States formally notified Russia of the breach, while Russian officials called the treaty unsuitable for Russia and unfair because other countries in Asia had such weapons. Russia later attacked the United States by calling American drones a "violation of the treaty".
On October 20, 2018, citing Russian non-compliance, US President Donald Trump announced that he was withdrawing the US from the treaty. The U.S. formally suspended the treaty on February 1, 2019, as did Russia the following day.

= = = Biological pigment = = =
Biological pigments are pigments which are chemical colours.
The colours of plants and animals have various functions. Chlorophyll is the green pigment used to collect light energy for photosynthesis in plants. Many colours on plants and animals work to change the behaviour of animals. They can be seen, and they act as a means of camouflage, warning or attraction (pollination; mating).
The common dark pigment melanin often has the function of protection against sunlight (ultraviolet radiation).
Pigments are different from structural colors. Pigments look the same from all angles. Structural color is the result of reflection or iridescence. For this reason, structural colors look different from different viewing angles. As an example, the wings of butterflies commonly use structural color.

= = = Structural color = = =
Structural coloration is a coloring that results from the special structure of the surface. Sometimes structural coloration is combined with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise, and green, and often they appear iridescent.
English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton were the first who observed structural coloration. Thomas Young described its principle a century later and called it wave interference. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from several surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces adds (interferes constructively), while at other angles, the light subtracts. As a result, different colors appear at different angles.

= = = Fast casual restaurant = = =
A fast casual restaurant is a type of restaurant invented in the United States. It aims to fill the gap between fast food joints and more formal restaurants.
This type of restaurant does not offer full table service. It gives a higher quality of food than fast food places. The fast casual restaurants use fewer frozen or processed ingredients than a fast food restaurant. 
The promoters of this idea see it as fitting between fast food and what they call "casual dining". By 'casual dining' they mean chains like TGI Friday's and Applebee's in the U.S. and Harvester in the U.K. 
The typical cost per meal in a fast casual is in the $8–$15 range. Typical examples of fast casual restaurants in the U.S. are Chipotle Mexican Grill, Culvers, and Panera.

= = = Buffet = = =
A buffet is a serve-yourself food system. 
Food is placed in a public area where the diners choose what they want. 
Buffets are now usual in many hotels for breakfast, and sometimes for other meals. They are also common at social events, where people stand up to eat and talk.
Buffet restaurants usually offer all-you-can-eat food for a set price. Buffets usually have some hot dishes. The term cold buffet (see Smörgåsbord) has been developed to describe buffets lacking hot food. Hot or cold buffets usually involve dishware and utensils, but a finger buffet is designed for small pieces taken by hand, such as cupcakes, slices of pizza, foods on cocktail sticks, etc.
The essential feature of the various buffet formats is that the diners can see the food and immediately select which dishes they wish to eat, and usually also can decide how much food they take. Buffets are effective for serving large numbers of people at once, and are often seen in institutional settings, such as business conventions or large parties.
Buffets grade into cafeterias when there is a serving counter and the customer moves with a tray along a track.

= = = Battle of Jena-Auerstadt = = =
The Battle of Jena-Auerstadt was fought on October 14, 1806. It was part of the War of the Fourth Coalition. It was fought between the French and the Prussians. The battle was a victory for Napoleon of France and he conquered Prussia.
Prelude.
In 1806 the Fourth Coalition was formed by Great Britain, Sweden, Russia, and Prussia against Napoleon and France. Napoleon invaded Prussia in the fall. Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel commanded the Prussians at Jena-Auerstadt. He was 71 years old while his field commanders were in their 60s. The Prussian army was still using tactics and training of Frederick II of Prussia. Its greatest weakness was its staff organization. Most of the divisions were poorly organized and did not communicate well with each other. Napoleon's army was experienced and well led. The armies met at Jena-Auerstadt on October 14, 1806.
Armies.
The Prussian army was split into three forces 
The French Army at Jena was made up of 150,000 men total-
At Auerstadt the French forces were Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's 1 Corps.
Battle of Jena.
The first French movements were to attack the Prussian flanks. Once in position, Marshal Ney attacked without orders. At first Ney's attack was successful, but he was soon cut off and under attack by the Prussians. Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes to help out. The French center was left weak, however, Napoleon deployed the Imperial Guard in the center and kept the Guard under his direct command. The rescue worked and Ney units were able to retreat. The Prussians did not take the initiative and attack. At 1 P.M. Napoleon made his move. The French flanks pushed hard against the Prussian flanks, and the French center attacked the Prussian center. The flank attacks worked and Prussians fled. They lost 10,000 men, 15,000 men were taken prisoner and 150 cannons were lost.
The Battle of Auerstadt.
Marshal Davout's III Corps was at the small village of Auerstedt. The Duke of Brunswick attacked with 60,000 men. However, the Prussians made piecemeal attacks, and the French held them off for 6 hours. Brunswick was mortally wounded and Prussian command broke down. The French destroyed the last Prussians assault and won the battle.
Aftermath.
At the end of the day Napoleon still did not know what was going on. Instead of directing his corps commanders he took charge himself. He forgot to send orders to several of his corps. He thought he had defeated the entire Prussian army when in fact he had only partially defeated them. There was still a large Prussian army of about 100,000 who were not in the battle. Napoleon didn't think Davout had completely beaten the Prussians and said "tell your marshal he is seeing double", a reference to Davout's bad eyesight. Davout was made Duke of Auerstadt. The French Army marched into Berlin and then peace terms were signed between France and Prussia.

= = = Myosin = = =
A myosin is a group of specialized proteins used for muscle contraction and motion in eukaryotic cells. Myosins need adenosine triphosphate for energy to do these functions. A large number of different myosin genes have been discovered in eukaryotes.
The structure and function of myosin is strongly conserved across species. For example, Rabbit muscle myosin II will bind to actin from an amoeba.
Structure and function.
Parts.
Most myosin molecules are composed of a head part, a neck part, and a tail part.
Power stroke.
Many myosin molecules can make muscles get shorter using the energy released from breaking apart ATP molecules into ADP molecules and a phosphate group. The power stroke happens when a phosphate that n broken off gets released from the myosin. This makes the myosin change shape so that it pulls against the actin. When the ADP molecule is released and a new ATP molecule joins onto the myosin head, the head releases from the actin. The myosin breaks the new ATP and the cycle keeps going. The combined effect of all the power strokes from all the different myosin molecules makes the muscle get shorter.

= = = Ocicat = = =
The Ocicat is a breed of cat. It looks like a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene pool. The Ocicat is spotted like a wild cat but is tame and has the behavior of a domestic animal. It got its name because it looks like an ocelot. The breed started accidentally by mating Siameses and Abyssinians. Later, American Shorthairs (silver tabby cats) were added to the mix. This gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and patterns. Now, the Ocicat is a popular breed all over the world.
Appearance.
There are twelve fur coat colors accepted for the Ocicat breed: tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, blue, lavender and fawn. As well, all have a shade of silver: black silver (ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver. Ocicats have eyes shaped like almonds. They have large strong bodies, legs with dark markings, and oval shaped paws. The eyes are usually rimmed with dark fur. These cats have dark spots all over their fur that are darker than their background color. The Ocicat's large, muscled body gives them a look of power and strength.
Behavior.
Most Ocicats are friendly and are not shy. This makes them good family pets. Most can also get along well with other animals. Their mood and actions are similar to those of a dog. Most can be trained to fetch toys, walk on a leash, come when called, and other dog-related tricks. Some even like the water. They are playful and like toys very much. So these pets need attention from their owners.
History.
The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, in Michigan, who tried to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. Her kittens looked like Abyssinians. But when they were later mated, there was not only an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese, but a spotted kitten,Tonga. The breeder's daughter, nicknamed Tonga an 'ocicat'. Tonga was sold as a pet, but his parent cats had more spotted kittens. This began the Ocicat breed. Other breeders then also did the same steps. They mated Siamese cats to Abyssinians, and then those cat descendents to Siameses to get Ocicat kittens. The Ocicat was accepted in The Cat Fanciers' Association and was first shown for championships in 1987. 

= = = Brasserie = = =
A brasserie, in France and nowadays in Britain, is a type of French restaurant. It has a relaxed setting, and serves single dishes and other meals. The word "brasserie" is also French for "brewery". In the beginning, it was used for the place where the beer was brewed. Often these places served the beer they brewed, together with a meal. 
A brasserie has professional service, printed menus, and (traditionally) white linen—unlike a bistro which may have none of these. Typically, a brasserie is open every day of the week and serves the same menu all day.
In 1901 "Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language" defined 'brasserie' as "in France, any beer-garden or saloon". In 2000 "The New Penguin English Dictionary" had this definition of 'brasserie': "a small informal French-style restaurant".

= = = Steam car = = =
A steam car is an automobile (car) powered by a steam engine. The first automobile, a three-wheeled vehicle, was powered by a steam engine. 
History.
The steam carriage was invented in 1769 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, a French engineer. It was a large three wheeled vehicle that used coal to make steam in a boiler. The boiler was mounted in front which made the vehicle unstable.
In the United States, about the time of the American Civil War, a number of inventors were working on steam-powered cars. In England about 1868 J. H. Knight had created a very successful design of steam car. In 1883 in France, Jules-Albert de Dion and Georges Bouton began building steam cars. In 1886 Ransom E. Olds was producing a steam car in the US. In 1899 the Stanley brothers, Francis and Freelan began making the famous Stanley Steamers.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Steam engines in cars have a great amount of torque. With all this torque they can accelerate very quickly. Because the torque is available over a broad range of speeds, a transmission wasn't needed. They could also carry heavy loads with ease. The speed of a steam car is controlled by the throttle alone and the engine never stalls. Steam cars had fewer moving parts than gasoline powered cars. Also steam cars are very quiet.
A major disadvantage is that a steam car has to "fire up" its boiler (has to get up to operating temperature). This can take as much as 20 minutes before the car can move. In the winter there was the added problem of water freezing. The open-cycle steam engine in cars and steam locomotives could not go far without adding water. The water turned to steam, which was lost when it exited the engine. Steam condensers were added to these cars later. This converted the steam back to water. It was too late; by then steam cars had lost out to cars with internal combustion engines.

= = = Principal photography = = =
Principal photography is the part of movie making when a movie is being filmed. It is after pre-production and before post-production.
Principal photography is usually the most expensive part of movie making. This is partly because the cost includes salaries for the actors and crew. It is also because some movie scenes are expensive if they include special props or special effects that are done on the set.
Feature movies usually have insurance when principal photography starts. This is in case something happens that makes the movie cost more to make. For example, if one of the actors dies before filming all his or her scenes, the scenes might have to be filmed again with a different actor. If sets or finished parts of the movie are destroyed, it might even be impossible to finish the movie.

= = = Dreadnoughtus = = =
Dreadnoughtus is a genus of giant titanosaurian dinosaur. Its fossilised skeleton was found in the Upper Cretaceous of Santa Cruz province, Argentina. These rocks date from 84–66 million years ago (mya).
This is one of the largest of all known terrestrial vertebrates. It has the greatest mass (weight) of any land animal that has been calculated. They used using limb bone measurements for the calculation.
"Dreadnoughtus schrani" is the most complete skeleton of a large titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur. Types of bones is the most important statistic. The completeness statistics for "Dreadnoughtus schrani" are as follows:
The specimen was probably not fully grown at the time of its death. The histology of its humerus, shows a lack of an outer layer of bone found only in fully-grown vertebrates. There is a lot of fast-deposited or still-growing bone tissue. Therefore, the specimen was still growing at the time of its death. It is unknown how large this individual would have grown if it had lived a full life.
Estimates.
As a matter of basic science, the estimates of dimensions such as the mass (weight) of extinct animals are very rough figures. To avoid the pretence of spurious accuracy. we only give rounded figures here. Moreover. all the skeletons are incomplete, which means that even length (the easiest dimension to estimate) cannot be given exactly. Published estimates by scientists are just that: "estimates". Estimation is an approximation given when information is not clear or is incomplete. It is like making an educated guess.
It is usual for estimates of mass (weight) to vary between experts. Using the same basic data, the weight of "Dreadnoughtus" has been estimated as:
There is a ~x2 difference between the heaviest and lightest estimates, and that is not at all unusual for this type of calculation.
= = = Karen Joy Fowler = = =
Karen Joy Fowler (born February 7, 1950, Bloomington, Indiana) is an American novelist and author. She usually does science fiction, fantasy and literary fiction. Her work often focuses on the lives of women and the 19th-century.
Fowler is best-known for being the novelist of the best-selling book "The Jane Austen Book Club". It was later adapted into a movie of the same name.
Fowler began publishing short stories in the mid-to-late 1980s. Two of her stories were "Recalling Cinderella" (1985) and "Artificial Things" (1986).
Fowler's first novel, "Sarah Canary" (1991), received strong positive reviews from book critics and readers. The novel is of several people that are alienated in the 19th-century America while dealing with peculiar first contact. One character is a Chinese American. The second character carries mental illness. The third character is a feminist. The last is Sarah herself.
Fowler later teamed up with the science fiction writer Pat Murphy to found the James Tiptree Jr. Award, the literary prize for science fiction and fiction which "expands of explores our understanding of gender." The prize was named for the science fiction author Alice Sheldon. Sheldon used the pen name James Tiptree Jr. for writing her books. The award's main focus is to recognize authors/novelists, female or male, who challenge and reflect shifting gender roles.
In 1987, Fowler received the Hugo Award related to her writing career.
Fowler's second novel, "The Sweetheart Season" (1996), is a romantic comedy mixed with historical and fantasy elements.
Fowler's 1998 collection, "Black Glass", won a World Fantasy Award. Her 2010 collections "What I Didn't See" and "Other Stories" won the same award.
In 2004, Fowler received a Nebula Award for her short book "What I Didn't See".
In 2008, Fowler won the Nebula Award a second time for the Best Short Story. The 2008 win was for her 2007 short story "Always". Another short story, "The Pelican Bar" won a Shirley Jackson Award in 2009 and a World Fantasy Award one year later.
Fowler's most recent novel, "We are All Completely Beside Ourselves" (2013) won a Pen/Faulkner Award for 2014. It was also nominated for a 2014 Nebula Award. It was later shortlisted with a 2014 Man Booker Prize.
Fowler received the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award during the 2020 convention.

= = = James Tiptree Jr. = = =
Alice Bradley Sheldon (born Alice Hastings Bradley; August 24, 1915 – May 19, 1987) was an American science fiction author. She was better known by her pen name James Tiptree Jr.. She used the pen name for her books from 1967 until her death. Before 1977, most people didn't know that James Tiptree Jr. was really a woman. Sheldon was added into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2012.
In 1936, Sheldon participated in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago. She had connections to the institute through her family. It showed some new American work. This was an important step forward for Sheldon's painting career. At this time Sheldon also took private art lessons from John Sloan. She disliked prudery in painting. While examining an anatomy book for an art class, Sheldon saw that the genitals were blurred. She then restored the genitals of the figures with a pencil.
In 1939, a nude self-portrait from Sheldon named "Portrait in the Country" was accepted for the "All-American" biennial at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.. The portrait was displayed there for just over six weeks. While these two shows were seen as big breaks, she downplayed the accomplishments. She said then that "only second-rate painters sold." Sheldon preferred keeping her art works at home.
The science fiction career.
Not long after Sheldon started writing science fiction, in 1967 she adopted the name James Tiptree Jr. The name "Tiptree" was from branded jars of marmalade. The "Jr." was the idea of her husband. In one interview, Sheldon said: "A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that men would slip by less observed. I've had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation."
The "Tiptree" pen name was maintained until late in 1977. That was in part because though the name was widely known as a pen name, it was well understood that its use was to protect the professional reputations of the intelligence community official.
But then, in 1976, "Tiptree" said during a letter that "his" mother, also a writer, died in Chicago. Those details led the fans to see the obituary. Sheldon's actual identity was then exposed.
The themes.
Before Sheldon's real identity was exposed, Tiptree was often known as an unusually macho male. However, Sheldon's view of sexual politics was ambiguous.
Death.
On May 19, 1987, Sheldon shot her husband and then herself. They were discovered dead, near each other in their Virginia home in bed.

Hoover was blamed for the Great Depression, and tried to ease it, but the Depression got worse. Roosevelt also had the advantage of name recognition, since he was the fifth cousin of the late Theodore Roosevelt.
This election marked the start of a long period where Democrats controlled the White House, as Democrats would win the next five elections. It also marked the beginning of Roosevelt's 12 years and 1 month as president, the longest tenure of any president.

The print edition was trmsfr in March 2014.
Lowering in earnings resulted in an August 2010 sale by The Washington Post Company to sounds technician Sidney Harman for a price of one dollar and taking ownership of any potential problems with the magazine.. Later that year, "Newsweek" joined with "The Daily Beast", making The Newsweek Daily Beast Company. In 2013, IBT Media said it had taken over "Newsweek" from IAC; the sale included the "Newsweek" name and its online newspaper, but not "The Daily Beast".

It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the British Raj in 1947. Pakistan came into existence as a result of the Pakistan Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of British India via partition. The movement was led by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan which comprised West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided with Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being Laylat al-Qadr, is regarded as sacred by Muslims.

= = = Movie adaptation = = =
Adapting a movie is the transfer of a certain work or story, either in part or in whole, to a motion picture. 
Common forms of movie adaptation are using a novel as the basis of a motion picture. Other works that are adapted to motion pictures are comic books, plays, historical sources and other movies.
Several plays from William Shakespeare have been adapted into movies. Those include "Hamlet", "Othello" and "Romeo and Juliet". Examples of Hamlet on screen are the 1969, 1990 and 1996 movies. Examples for "Romeo and Juliet" being adapted under film include the 1936, 1968 and "Romeo + Juliet" (1996) movies.
Across Britain, where stage plays tend being more popular for entertainment than in the United States, many movies start off as stage productions. Examples of British and British-American motion pictures based on successful British plays include "Gaslight" (1940), "Shirley Valentine" (1989) and "The Madness of King George" (1994).
In similar, hit Broadway plays are often adapted under movies. Examples of Broadway plays adapted under movies are "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1951), "Children of a Lesser God" (1986), "Glengarry Glen Ross" (1992) and "Real Women Have Curves" (2002).
Movies are sometimes created from a television series. In some cases, the movie offers a longer storyline than the usual television program format. In the adaptation of "The X-Files" to the movie format, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Adaptations of television shows will give the viewers an opportunity of seeing that show's characters without broadcast restrictions. Such additions–explicit sexual content, profanity, nudity, drug use, adult themes or graphic violence–are only the shown adaptive addition. Movie versions of "Miami Vice" and "South Park" are examples of such motion pictures adapted off the related television programs.
Awards.
Certain major movies' award programs present awards for adapted screenplays, different from those for original screenplays.
The adaptation of motion pictures.
When movies' screenplays are original, they are also the sources for derivative works, like novels and plays. For example, certain movie studios will sell the rights of popular title to novel publishing companies.
Novelization builds up the characters and events happening for commercial reasons.

Sally Hemings (1773 – 1835) was an enslaved woman from Virginia. She is famous for her relationship with Thomas Jefferson. People say she was his mistress or his concubine or the girl he was raping, but we do not know for sure. We do know that they had six children together over many years. Most of what we know about Sally Hemings comes from things her son, Madison, said about her many years later.
Early life and family.
According to Madison Hemings, Sally Hemings' grandmother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include "Dinah," "Judy," "Abbie," "Sarah," "Parthenia," and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named "Thenia" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that "Sally" is a nickname for "Sarah," and there were many girls named "Sarah" and "Sally" in the Hemings family too.
Sally Hemings' mother was called Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings. Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.
Captain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one, because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says "about 1735." 
Elizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred, until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband could not. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.
Elizabeth Hemings had many children. The father of most of those children, including Sally, was John Wayles. John Wayles also had children with his wife, Martha Eppes. This made Sally Hemings the half-sister of Martha Wayles Skelton, who married Thomas Jefferson.
When Martha Wayles Skelton married Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Sally Hemings was about ten years old when Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson died. Historians think Sally Hemings and her mother Elizabeth may have helped take care of Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson when she was sick. Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson left Sally a present in her will: a small silver bell.
Youth and trip to France.
When Thomas Jefferson went to France to be ambassador, he only took his oldest daughter with him. He also took Sally Hemings's older brother, James Hemings. Jefferson left his younger two daughters behind with his wife's relatives in Virginia. Then the youngest of the three girls died. Jefferson then wrote to his wife's relatives and asked them to send the middle girl, Maria, nicknamed "Polly," to him in France. It took two years for them to agree.
Jefferson told the relatives to choose one of the enslaved women to go with his daughter to France. He said the woman should be older, already inoculated for smallpox, and of a steady personality. He asked for an enslaved woman named Isabel, then twenty-nine years old. But Isabel had just had a baby, so she could not come. Jefferson's wife's relatives sent Sally Hemings instead. Sally Hemings was not any of the three things Jefferson had asked for. She was only fourteen, not inoculated for smallpox, and had a lively personality.
Abigail Adams met Hemings when the ship stopped in London. Abigail Adams wrote to Jefferson and said he should send Hemings back to Virginia on a ship, but he did not. She said Hemings would probably be as much work to take care of as Polly was. She wrote that Hemings was running around, laughing, and playing with Polly. At the time, Adams thought Hemings was sixteen years old, but she was really fourteen years old. We do not know for sure why Abigail Adams wanted Jefferson to send Hemings back to Virginia.
In France, Hemings worked as a servant for Jefferson and as a lady's maid to Jefferson's oldest daughter, Martha. Jefferson paid her. Jefferson's writings show him buying clothes that Hemings could wear to outings with Martha. We do not know when Jefferson began having sex with Hemings. She was pregnant when Jefferson wanted to go back to Virginia.
Historian Annette Gordon-Reed wonders why Hemings agreed to go back to Virginia with Jefferson. About 1000 black people lived in Paris at the time, and more of them were men than women. Gordon-Reed notes that if Sally Hemings had stayed in Paris, she probably could have gotten married or started her own business if she'd wanted to. Gordon-Reed says that Jefferson had planned to come back to France after staying in Virginia only a short time. But the French Revolution's Reign of Terror happened, and he changed his plans.
The laws of France in the 1770s and 1780s did not allow people to keep slaves in France (they could keep slaves in France's colonies). People who brought slaves to France had to either send them away or free them within a certain time. Enslaved people who knew about the law sometimes went to the admiralty court and asked the French government to say they were free. Sally Hemings and her brother could have done this. Gordon-Reed notes that this would have made Jefferson and the United States look bad to the French. She also notes that if Jefferson had freed James and Sally Hemings, it would have made Jefferson and the United States look good to the French.
However, neither of these two things happened. According to Hemings and Jefferson's son Madison, Sally Hemings negotiated with Jefferson. Jefferson, James Hemings, and Sally Hemings made a deal in private: Jefferson promised to free all of Sally Hemings's children, whether he was their father or not. Jefferson promised to free James Hemings after he had taught more people at Monticello how to cook in the French way.
Children.
Four of Hemings' children lived to be adults.
Later life.
Visitors to Monticello remembered Sally Hemings taking care of Jefferson's clothes and sewing. In Jefferson's writings, he called her "Maria's maid."
Legally, Sally Hemings was never freed. But historians believe that Jefferson's daughter Martha "gave Sally her time." This was a thing that slave owners would do in the early 1800s: They would let an older slave live as if they were free.
The 1830 Virginia census lists Sally, Madison, and Eston as free white people. The 1831 census lists Sally Hemings as a "free mulatto," meaning a free person who is half white and half black. In that census, Hemings said she had been living in Charlottesville, Virginia since 1826.
Scandal.
People who did not like Jefferson wrote about him and Hemings. They said the fact that Jefferson had children with a black woman was a reason not to vote for him.
In 1802, Jefferson was President of the United States. That year, writer James Callendar wrote about Jefferson and Hemings in his newspaper. He called Sally Hemings a "concubine" and said that she and Jefferson had children.
Cover up.
Virginia became more racist as the American Civil War got closer. Jefferson's grandchildren did not want people to know their grandfather had sex with a black woman. They told people that perhaps Jefferson's nephew had been the father of Hemings's children. A man named Edmund Bacon wrote about working as an overseer at Monticello and said Jefferson was not the father of Harriet Hemings. But Bacon was not at Monticello until after Harriet was five years old.
During the 20th century, not all historians believed that Jefferson was the father of Hemings's children. Even Eston Hemings Jefferson's descendants changed their story: They said one of Jefferson's other relatives must have been Eston's father.
DNA test.
In 1998, DNA testing showed that someone from Jefferson's male line must have been the father of Hemings's son Eston. Scientists tested the Y chromosome of Jefferson's uncle and the Y chromosome of Jefferson's nephews' grandfather on their own father's side. They compared these chromosomes to the Y chromosomes of Eston's male descendants. They found that Eston's family had Y chromosomes like Jefferson's and not like his nephews'. Before the tests, about a third of historians believed Thomas Jefferson had been the father of Hemings' children, about a third did not, and about a third were undecided. After the test, about two thirds believed Thomas Jefferson was the father of Hemings' children.
Because Jefferson's nephews were not of his same male line, none of them could have been Eston's father. Historian Gordon-Reed matched this against letters and other records showing when Jefferson and Hemings were in the same place, and said that Jefferson could have been the father of all Hemings' children. For example, he was always at Monticello the right number of months before one of Hemings's children was born.
In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation said it was likely that Jefferson was the father of all Hemings's children.
In 2001, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society said Jefferson's younger brother must have been the father of Hemings's children.
Appearance.
We do not know what Sally Hemings looked like. Newspapers making fun of Jefferson drew pictures of her as very dark-skinned, but most of those artists had never seen her. People who saw Hemings and wrote about her said she was light-skinned with long, straight hair.
One visitor to Monticello said she was very beautiful. She was 37 when he saw her and had already had many children.
In popular culture.
In 1995, the movie "Jefferson in Paris" showed Hemings as an older teenager who willingly seeks a relationship with Jefferson. In this movie, she returns with Jefferson to Virginia because she wants to go home.

= = = Sexual objectification = = =
Sexually objectifying a person means to view them like things for sexual desire.
Both males and females can be sexually objectified, as can children and teenagers. Women and girls, however, are more likely victims of sexual objectification than men and boys. The concept of sexual objectification toward females is very important for some feminist theories. The sexual objectification toward women and girls contributes to bad treatment against them and to gender inequality. A number of psychologists link sexual objectification under some physical and mental health risks for women and girls.
Sexual objectification of women.
The sexual objectification of women/girls has them being viewed like an object under male sexual desires, not as a whole person. Opinions differ, however, on which situations are objectionable. Many see the sexual objectifying of women/girls taking place with sexual portrayals involving them under art, media, advertising, pornography, prostitution and beauty contests.
There is also evidence showing that females are sometimes sexually objectified by other females.
Sexual objectification of Hispanic/Latina women.
Hispanic or Latina females are more often sexually objectified under stereotypes (unfair generalisations) toward them. The American media often portray these women as more likely to perform casual sex with multiple partners. The same media portray these females as having curved shapes, large breasts, large buttocks, having a melodramatic (over-the-top) attitude or being feisty.
Sexual objectification of men.
Women also sometimes see men as sex objects. This often happens in movies and in advertising. It also happens in some television programs.Erotic shows (such as a striptease), or pornography may reduce men to sex objects.

Due to the Crimean crisis, Mizulina was punished by Canada, the United States and Western Europe.
Legislative work.
Mizulina was involved with a number of controversial legislative projects. Those included:
Views toward marriage, sexual relations and family.
Mizulina believes in limiting women's rights to abortion. She pledged to let abortions remain free of charge only under medical reasons or cases involving rape. In all other cases, she believed abortions should be billed to the women seeking such treatments.
Mizulina led an effort to decriminalize domestic violence in Russia. In 2016, she told reporters: "A man beating his wife is less offensive than when a man is humiliated."
Mizulina had strong opinions and views toward United States citizens adopting Russian children. She voted for the Anti-Magnitsky bill. The bill forbids when people in and from the United States adopt Russian children.
Mizulina is against homosexuality and LGBT rights. She is the author for some legislative projects that are directed against "the propaganda of homosexuality." They include the Russian gay propaganda law. She believes the phrase "gays are people too" should be marked as extremist by the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare. Mizulina was also in favor of taking children from gay parents, even biological parents.
In June 2012, Mizulina and the Duma Committee put into public a project called "The State Concept of Family Policy Until 2025". This policy proposed several controversial elements. They include:
After the publication of "Concept", it was pointed out that several positions described in it were plagiarized word-for-word from a school report published in free access on the Internet. That in turn was plagiarized from a curriculum of family studies in Tomsk Polytechnic University.
In that same context, Mizulina called for the animated sitcom "South Park" to be removed from Russian airwaves.
The criticism toward Mizulina.
Russian political scientist Mark Urnov described laws set in motion by Mizulina as "diverse, but having a single common quality – their capacity to spread intolerance. They are simply a legal expression of the intolerance and the suppression of everything that corresponds to one's personal views in regard to what is right and wrong".
The writer Dmitri Bykov believed Mizulina was "constantly providing a legislative form for things that should remain a question of personal choice, which is far more dangerous than any gay pride parade".
In April 2019, Mizulina was widely quoted for her statements in defense of the Russian Internet censorship laws. Her statements were condemned as Orwellian by several journalists.

= = = Rorschach test = = =
The Rorschach test is a psychological test in a form of inkblots on the cards. It is still used. It was named after Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach.
The test determines the state of patients and their problems.
History.
Herman Rorschach was not the first who invented this method. Interpretation of inkblots was used in the game Gobolink from the late 19th century. In Europe such games were known as kleksography. 
Then Alfred Binet appeared. He first used it for psychological research. It determined the work of the imagination and consciousness. 
In 1921, Rorschach wrote his main book "Psychodiagnostik" where he described the test. 
Also Austrian psychologist SIgmund Freud showed how psychic expressions of the individual (in speech, dreams, and so on) could be read as signs pointing to unconscious processes. These processes were significant for a fuller and deeper understanding of his personality. Finally, Freud stressed the very earliest experiences of the child in the family as of primary significance in the moulding of personality. 
Similar tests have been devised by American psychologist Wayne H. Holtzman. 
Later the test began to be used in all sorts of speculative ways. Researchers gave the test to Nazi criminals during Nuremberg Trials hoping to find out the psychological roots of mass murder.
Method.
Rorschach showed inkblots to many people with the same question: "What might this be?". It showed how people approached the task. It showed also a different perception of people. Some people saw the movement on the pictures, some not. 
Usually inkblots pictures are shown secretly to make the patients' responses spontaneous. 
In mass culture.
Rorschach test is used in many films, TV series, books, comics.

After the so-called Pakistan Civil War (1971), Act Number 9 of 1973 (called The Bangladesh Passport Order, 1973) which was signed into effect by the President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on 8 February 1973, this led to the creation and issuing of the first passport of a newly separatist Bangladesh. These passport booklets were traditional, handwritten or manual, passports and were compliant with the relevant international laws and regulations in force at the time. Subsequently, additional laws were enacted in Bangladesh in the years that followed to improve the passport application process; enforce the ineligibility to hold multiple valid Bangladeshi passports; citizenship requirement for a passport; etc. Since 1972 a special passport, also known as the India-Bangladesh Special Passport, used to be issued to Bangladeshi citizens and Indian nationals resident in West Bengal State and the North-Eastern States of India only.

= = = Dangerous goods = = =
Dangerous goods (DG in short) are substances that when transported pose risk to health, safety, property and the environment. Certain dangerous goods pose risk even when not being transported. These are known as hazardous materials (HAZMAT or hazmat for short).
Hazardous material is often subject under chemical regulations. Examples of dangerous goods are biological hazards, flammable, explosive material, corrosive substances and allergens.
The packing groups.
Packing groups are used for the purpose of determining the degree of protective packaging required for dangerous goods during transportation.
The training.
Permit cards or licenses that are used with hazmat training must be shown if requested by officials.
By country/region.
Canada.
The transportation of dangerous goods (hazardous material) in Canada by road is normally a province jurisdiction. The federal government in Canada have jurisdiction over air, most marine and most rail transport. The federal government acting centrally created the federal transportation of dangerous goods and regulations. Creation of the federal regulations was coordinated under Transport Canada. The hazard classification is based under the UN model.
Europe.
The European Union passed several directives and regulations. They did so for avoiding wide-spreading and for restricting the use of hazardous substances. The most important ones were the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals.
The European law clearly tells the difference between the law of dangerous goods and the law of hazardous material. The earlier refers mainly to the transport of the respective goods. That includes interim storage, if caused by the transport. The latter refers to requirements of storage (which would include the warehousing) and usage of hazardous materials. The difference is very important, because different directives and orders of European law are applied.
The United States.
For reasons involving increases in terrorism just after the September 11 attacks in 2001, funding for greater hazmat-handling went up across the United States. It was recognized that flammable, poisonous and explosive material could be used for further terrorist attacks.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates hazardous materials, for they may impact a community and an environment.

= = = Himalayan salt = = =
Himalayan salt, also known as Himalayan Pink salt, comes from the northern Punjab region of Pakistan. It is rock salt or halite with a pinkish color from minerals. People use it in cooking, as a table salt replacement, and for decoration or spa treatments. Many like it for its health benefits because it's full of minerals. It's mined in the Salt Range mountains of Pothohar plateau, not the Himalayas, even though it's called Himalayan salt.
It is also used to make "salt lamps" that radiate a pinkish or orangish light, manufactured by placing a light source within the hollowed-out interior of a block of Himalayan salt. Claims that their use results in the release of ions that benefit health are without foundation.
Origin.
The pink color of Himalayan salt comes from iron oxide impurities. It is mined from the Salt Range mountains in the southern part of the Pothohar Plateau, south of the Himalayas in Pakistan. Himalayan salt is obtained from a thick layer of Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites in the Salt Range Formation. This geological formation includes crystalline halite mixed with potash salts, covered by gypsiferous marl, and interlayered with gypsum and dolomite beds, along with occasional seams of oil shale. 
These formations in the Pothohar Plateau date back to 600-540 million years ago. Over time, these strata and the succeeding Cambrian to Eocene sedimentary rocks were pushed southward and eroded, forming the Salt Range. The highest peak in this range is Sakaser, standing at 1522 m. Commercial salt mining has been ongoing here since at least the 16th century, with active salt mines in Khewra, Warcha, Kalabagh, and Jatta.
Legend has it that the Khewra deposit was discovered by horses in Alexander the Great's army, but historical records trace mining back to the Janjua clan of Punjabis in the 1200s. The Khewra salt mine is the second-largest salt mine in the world.
Composition.
Analysis of Himalayan pink salt samples show that they are mostly 96% to 99% sodium chloride, with small amounts of calcium, iron, zinc, chromium, magnesium, and sulfur, all within safe levels below 1%. However, some salts from Pakistan need purification before use in food or industry because of impurities. Salt crystals from this area can be off-white to transparent, while certain veins may have a pink, reddish, or beet-red color due to trace minerals.
Nutritionally, Himalayan salt is much like regular table salt. A study in Australia found that Himalayan salt contains higher levels of various elements, including calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, aluminum, barium, silicon, and sulfur, and lower sodium levels compared to table salt. However, the study suggested that consuming "exceedingly high amounts" (almost 600% more than the recommended daily salt intake) would be needed for these differences to matter. At such high levels, any potential nutritional benefits would be outweighed by the risks of consuming too much sodium. One crucial difference is in iodine content. Many table salts are iodine-supplemented, helping prevent iodine deficiency disorders. Himalayan salt lacks this iodine supplementation.

Additional structures on the site may have served as residences or meeting halls, or for secular purposes. All of the buildings on the site are constructed from local stone, and are mortared with lime and mud.
Name meaning.
The word Takht-I-Bahi may have different explanations. Local believes that site got its name from two wells on the hill or the springs nearby. In Persian, "Takht" means 'top' or 'throne' while "Bahi" means 'spring' or 'water'. When combined together its meaning is 'spring from the top' or 'high spring', and there were two springs on the top of mountains. Another meaning suggested is 'throne of origin'.

It stars Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, André Morell, Marla Landi, David Oxley, Miles Malleson, Sam Kydd, Helen Goss, Ewen Solon and was distributed by United Artists.
Plot.
Dr. Richard Mortimer recounts to Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson the legend of the ghost hound that killed the devilish Sir Hugo Baskerville for his murder of the daughter of a servant. He asks Holmes to investigate the death of his friend Sir Charles Baskerville, in Dartmoor, from heart failure, lying in the moor surrounding his estate, Baskerville Hall, with a look of horror on his face. Mortimer fears for the life of Sir Henry, who's just come from South Africa to take possession of his inheritance and of Baskerville Hall.
Although sceptical, Holmes and Watson accept to meet Sir Henry, who is young and bold, but in truth suffers from a congenital heart problem. A incident with a tarantula convinces Holmes that Sir Henry's life is indeed in danger, and, busy with a prior commitment, he chooses to despatch Watson to Dartmoor with Mortimer and Sir Henry. Holmes reminds Sir Henry not to go out onto the nearby moor after dark.
On their way to Baskerville Hall, the trio is warned by the coach driver Perkins that a murderous convict named Selden has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison and is hiding on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, Sir Henry gets acquainted with his new house, helped by the butler, Mr. Barrymore, and his wife. On the walls stands a portrait Sir Hugo. A second portrait of Sir Hugo is missing, and the Barrymores are unable to offer any explanation.
The next day, Sir Henry and Watson walk around to see the neighborhood. At the nearby village, they meet the comedic local pastor, Bishop Frankland, who is also a keen entomologist. While crossing the moor, Watson finds the Grimpen Mire and Watson gets trapped in a patch of quicksand. Two people come to help, a man named Stapleton and his daughter Cecille, a wild girl who immediately bewitches Sir Henry.
One night, Watson sees a light in the moor. He and Sir Henry go out to investigate, but a strange man rushes by in the shadows, then a distant hound howls, upsetting Sir Henry so much that he suffers a heart condition. Watson spots a man silhouetted on a hill in the distance, while he helps Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall. Watson finds the silhouetted figure to be Holmes, who has concealed his own arrival to investigate more freely. After his death, Holmes and Watson find the corpse of the convict Selden, mutilated in a ritual, while wearing clothes belonging to Sir Henry, and the legendary curved dagger used by Sir Hugo. This clue exposes the Barrymores, who confess to have helped the escapee, who was their relative, by supplying food and other provisions each time he signalled with a light from his hideout. However, Holmes has evidence that neither the Barrymores nor Selden are connected to the death of Sir Charles, so he keeps on searching for clues to confirm the existence of the mysterious hound and the identity of its masters.
Facing personal danger in an abandoned copper mine, and thanks to the stolen portrait of Sir Hugo, Holmes is able to guess the Stapletons are illegitimate descendants of Sir Hugo and are next in line to inherit the Baskerville fortune and mansion if all of the Baskervilles perish. Holmes deduces this after questioning Barrymore about the missing portrait; it was stolen because it revealed the fingers on Sir Hugo's right hand were webbed just like Stapleton's. Cecile takes Sir Henry out onto the same place where, according to the legend, the ghost hound had killed Sir Hugo. Holmes and Watson arrive just in time to hear Cecile reveal her intentions to a horrified Sir Henry. The dog attacks Sir Henry. Stapleton attacks with the dagger, but Watson shoots and wounds him. Holmes shoots the dog; it then turns on Stapleton and mauls him to death. Cecille flees after Holmes kills the beast, revealing it to be a Great Dane wearing a hideous mask to make it look more terrifying. Cecile accidentally falls into the mire and sinks to her death. Holmes and Watson take a shocked Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall.
Writing.
There are several significant changes in plot details. Among them:
The Conan Doyle Estate did not approve of the changes made to suit Hammer's more horror-centric success. Cushing, however, took no objection to the changes as he felt the character of Holmes remained intact.
Casting.
Cushing was an aficionado of Sherlock Holmes and brought his knowledge to the project. He reread the stories, made detailed notes in his script and sought to portray Holmes closer to his literary counterpart. It was Cushing's suggestion that the mantlepiece feature Holmes' correspondence transfixed to it with a jackknife as per the original stories. However, when producer Anthony Hinds suggested excluding the famous deerstalker Cushing objected, saying Holmes' headgear and pipes would be expected by the audience. Cushing scrutinised the costumes and screenwriter Peter Bryan's script, often altering words or phrases. Lee later claimed to be awestruck by Cushing's ability to incorporate many different props and actions into his performance simultaneously, whether reading, smoking a pipe, drinking whiskey, filing through papers or other things while portraying Holmes. Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle's stories, and away from the bumbling stereotype established by Nigel Bruce's interpretation of the role.
David Oxley had an extraordinarily powerful voice that he used to great effect, being able to fill an auditorium without the aid of microphones, and seen to best effect as Hugo Baskerville.

Baywatch is a 2017 American action-comedy movie. It was adapted off the television series of the same name.
Principal photography started on February 22, 2016 across Florida and Savannah, Georgia. "Baywatch" was released in May 2017. The movie got substandard reviews from the critics, mostly for its crude humor and character developments. However, it had a box office intake of just over $58 million in the United States. It made another $119.8 million in several other territories. The total box office intake was around $177.8 million. The movie's budget was $69 million. "Baywatch" was given five nominations in the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards. The categories were the Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, the Worst Screenplay, the Razzie Nominee So Rotten You Loved It and the Worst Picture. 
The reviews.
"Baywatch" received an approval rating of only 17% under Rotten Tomatoes. Critics from the movie judging site said: ""Baywatch" takes its source material's jiggle factor to R-rated levels, but lacks the original's campy charm – and leaves its charming stars flailing in the shallows." It received a rating of 37 out of 100 under Metacritic. That meant "generally unfavorable reviews.".
Writing for the "Rolling Stone" magazine, Peter Travers was happy with the "easy rapport" from Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Travers stated, though, "what [the film] needs more is a functional script". Travers rated the movie two out of four stars. He then said: "Think of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&amp;Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke the whole thing up so you can forget about it in the morning. That's "Baywatch" in a nutshell." Owen Gleiberman from the "Variety" magazine called it "stupidly entertaining... for a while". He was, however, not impressed with the movie's plot.

The game takes place a year after the events of the "Macross 7" television series and follows the VF-X Ravens unit. The game was followed by a sequel, "Macross VF-X2" in September 2, 1999.
Overview.
This is a shooting game based on the series, and is a wholly original setting not based on any previous works or series. It is set one year after "Macross 7". The game was initially planned as a fully polygonal 3D shooter, and the Sony PlayStation perfectly suited the game's ambition in terms of graphics.
Development began in 1995. The development involves the main creators of the Macross series, such as Shōji Kawamori (Valkyrie Design, Supervisor), Kazutaka Miyatake (Ship / Mecha Design), Haruhiko Mikimoto (Main Character Design). The game was noted for including the transformable modes of the VF-4 Lightning III, which had only been previously seen as a fighter on "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012".
Until the game's development, Macross-related games were released on family computers, PC engines and arcades without the involvement of Shōji Kawamori. Kawamori was uninterested in video game development at that point because he could only do 2D, but he had become interested when he learned the game was being made in 3D for the Sony Playstation.

= = = Texas Two-Step = = =
The Texas Two-Step is a dance that originated in 1845 when Texas was first founded. Within 2 months, the founders of Texas (Davie Rocket, John Menger III, Chris Alamo, and Antonio Sanders) adopted the dance as a staple of Texas heritage. Historians still argue about if the dance originated after the successful Battle of the Bulge or the war of 1899 with Houston.
The dance is performed by putting your lead foot behind your support foot while simultaneously twisting your pelvis in a counter-clockwise motion, being sure to point your toes toward your partner. Keep in mind, the entirety of the dance is completed by two Texas sized steps (around 4.2x as large as a standard U.S. step). What follows these two steps is a series of freestyle movements that vary between performers. For example, Davie Rocket adopted the "Hemisfair" movement, where you proceed to grab your partner by the pinky and swing her around your head similar to the motion of a lasso.
Importance.
The Texas Two-Step and other forms of step related lone star dances have become a cultural staple of the state down under. Bordering states have attempted to plagiarize this dance in ways of their own, but to no avail. For example, Louisiana created the Boot Stompin' Bop, until it faded into obscurity in 1923 after the housing market crash. Arkansas native Dick Rutherford created the Whiskey Slammer Toe Spinner, but 2 minutes into the debut of the dance, Dick was shot in the Golden Monkey Saloon. The only dance to remain a southern tradition as much as the Texas Two-Step, is the Texas Two-Step.
Notable Sightings.
Many notable individuals have been seen in public performing the famous dance. Tom Alamodome, John "Hand-Standin'" Johnson, and Brett were all sighted at Shiner Park performing the moves of the golden days. They were all sighted by Eva Longoria, former Spurs trophy wife.

= = = Death of Mario Gonzalez = = =
On April 19, 2021, Mario Gonzalez, a 26-year-old Latino man was killed by the Alameda Police Department. In their initial report of the incident, the department reported that Gonzalez died after a “scuffle” and “physical altercation” resulting in a “medical emergency.” In body cam footage released on April 27, Gonzalez could be seen being pinned to the ground for more than five minutes after refusing to provide identification, eventually becoming unresponsive. He died in police custody.
People involved.
Mario Gonzalez.
Mario Gonzalez (December 24, 1994 – April 19, 2021) was a 26-year-old man from Oakland, California. He was a father and was the primary caretaker of his mother and brother, who has autism.
Officers.
The officers involved with Gonzalez' death were identified as Eric McKinley, who has been on the force for three years, Cameron Leahy, who has been on the force for three years, and James Fisher, who has been on the force for 10 years. The three men have been placed on paid administrative leave.
Incident.
An officer approaches Gonzalez at a park after police said they were responding to reports of a man who was believed to be intoxicated and suspected of theft. Gonzalez was in the park with two baskets. Officials asked him to produce his name and identification; Gonzalez does not produce an ID, and an officer states, "Please put your hand behind your back ... please stop resisting us." The officers push Gonzalez into the ground into wood chips, placing a knee on his back and leaving it there for four minutes as an out-of-breath Gonzalez says, "I didn't do nothing." and “Please don’t do this.” Gonzalez loses consciousness, at which point the officers rolled him over and perform CPR. He was pronounced dead.
Investigation.
Alameda city officials launched an independent investigation into Gonzalez' death.
Reactions.
Family.
Gonzalez' brother stated, "Everything we saw in that video was unnecessary and unprofessional. The police killed my brother in the same manner that they killed George Floyd." Julia Sherwin, a lawyer representing the Gonzalez family, stated, "His death was completely avoidable and unnecessary. Drunk guy in a park doesn't equal a capital sentence."
Institutions.
CURYJ Executive Director George Galvis stated, “We have seen this play out time and time again. Police come up with a false narrative until footage is revealed and the truth comes out. They did this to 13-year-old Adam Toledo, and they would have done it to George Floyd if there wasn’t community recording.”
Public figures.
Alameda mayor Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft stated, “I’m just heartsick. This is a young man. This shouldn't have happened."
On Twitter, former-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro wrote, "Police in Alameda, CA wrote in a report that Mario Gonzalez was violent before his arrest and died in the hospital after a 'medical emergency.' Body cam footage shows he was calm and peaceful. He died on-site after they knelt on his back for 5 minutes."

Apple Inc. had just over $2.1 trillion as of June 2021. Microsoft had almost $1.8 trillion by that same time. Tesla had about $641 billion by June 2021. The biggest United Kingdom business networks are HSBC, Barclays, Unilever and BP (called British Petroleum before 1998).
The history of big business.
According to the "Oxford English Dictionary", the words "big business" were first mentioned in Frederic Clemson Howe's book "The City: the Hope of Democracy"' in 1905.
The automotive industry started off small in the late 19th century. They grew very fast after large-scale gasoline was developed during the early 20th century.
New technology from computers spread across the world in the years following World War II. Businesses built around computer technology include though are not limited to Microsoft, Apple Inc., Intel, IBM and Samsung.
The criticism of big business.
There are various efforts being made to investigate the effects of "bigness" toward workers, consumers and investors. The effects toward prices and competition are also being looked at.
Large corporations have been subjected to strong controversy and criticism for abusing their employees, exploiting workers, political corruption, white-collar crime and corporate scandals. 
Contrary to popular belief, not all corporations in the United States associate with the Republican Party. Several companies, Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola and Major League Baseball went against Georgia's new and restrictive voting laws. Amazon, Google and Starbucks signed a statement that was against legislation which would discriminate against people who have certain racial, ethnic or disability backgrounds and those with certain sexual preferences.
Many Americans believe that corporations have too much power.
Corporate concentration can lead to influence over government in areas such as tax policy, trade policy, environmental policy, foreign policy, and labor policy through lobbying. In 2005, the majority of Americans believed that big business has "too much power in Washington."

= = = Free Britney movement = = =
The Free Britney movement is an Internet social movement. Members with the movement are working for American Britney Spears to be freed from her years-long and court-ordered conservatorship (the appointment of court-ordered guardians or protectors by court judges). The Free Britney movement was begun in 2008. The movement became popular in 2019.
The background.
In 2008, Spears was placed into a three-day psychiatric hold two separate times. At the time, she was experiencing serious conflicts which affected her personal life. Those conflicts include divorcing her then-husband Kevin Federline in late 2007, attacking paparazzi, shaving her head and losing the custody of her two sons with Federline. Just after the second hospital visit, Spears' father Jamie filed to put a temporary conservatorship on her. The conservatorship was made permanent later in 2008. Jamie was the conservator for Britney's personal affair and co-conservator for her finances with Andrew Wallet. Wallet was in charge starting in 2009. He resigned his position in March 2019. Due to stress from her father Jamie's afflictions, Britney went into a mental health facility the same month. She was released the following month from the mental health facility.
The inception and outcomes.
In April 2019, a podcast that involved Britney, titled "Britney's Gram", put out voicemails from an anonymous party saying they were the former members of her legal team. The anonymous party also said her planned second residency was canceled by her father Jamie due to Britney not always wanting to take her medication. They then said Britney was involuntarily held in the facility beginning in January after she violated rules that banned her from driving. Finally, they said the conservatorship was originally scheduled to end in 2009. Shortly after the podcast episode, a movement to end the conservatorship, called #FreeBritney, became widely known. In May, the Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny, the judge over the case, ordered an "expert evaluation" of the arrangement during a hearing. In September 2019, her former husband Federline was then granted a restraining order against Britney's father Jamie just after what might have been a physical dispute between Jamie and one of Federline's and Britney's sons. The order was sought when Federline said Jamie broke down a door to get his grandson. When the grandson was in his room, Federline said, Jamie grabbed him.
The Los Angeles divorce attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan stated there was a disagreement that took place when Britney and her sons were visiting Jamie at his home. According to Kaplan, the disagreement led to a serious act of physical violence that was observed by Britney's and Federline's older son Jayden. Kaplan credited Britney for removing the children from the area.
Britney Spears gave notice to the court on June 23, 2021 and talked about having trauma. She described the conservatorship as "abusive". She then expressed her wishes for choosing her own legal representation and to marry and have another child. She asked Penny to dissolve the conservatorship without further evaluation. The request to end the conservatorship, however, was later denied by Penny. During a court hearing in July 2021, Britney Spears was given the right to choose her own lawyer. Judge Penny then approved the replacement of Spears' previous lawyer Samuel Ingham with Matthew Rosengart. The new lawyer said he would be working to dissolve the conservatorship. 
A public response.
From 2019 to 2021, the #FreeBritney movement gained support from many celebrities. They included singers Miley Cyrus and Cher and media personality Paris Hilton. The singers Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, the earlier of whom was Spears' past boyfriend, also voiced their support. The latter also said Spears' conservatorship was "unacceptable".
U.S. Burgess Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Biggs and Matt Gaetz invited Spears to testify on her conservatorship to United States Congress. In relation to Spears' case, U.S. Senators Bob Casey Jr. and Elizabeth Warren called on the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice to give them data on conservatorships so they could make policy-related recommending on the system. Casey Jr. and Warren called for more federal oversight on the guardianship system in the United States after Spears' testimony. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a nonprofit organization, decided they would help Spears in dissolving the conservatorship if she requested to do so. They filed an "amicus curiae" to support Spears' plea to choose her own legal representation.

= = = Conservatorship = = =
In United States law, conservatorship is when a protector or guardian is appointed by a court judge to manage the financial affairs for another person. This is usually because that person is old or has physical or mental health problems. People in a conservatorship are called "conservatees". Conservatees are usually adults. A person in guardianship is called a "ward". The term "ward" is usually used in reference to minors (people under age 18). Conservatorship may also be used for corporations or organizations.
Appointment of conservatorships.
"Conservatorship" refers to the legal responsibility over a person who has a certain mental disorder or a physical health problem. This includes people affected with psychosis, suicidal ideation, certain levels of autism or in some other way are not able to make medical, financial or legal decisions for themselves. 
In relation to the government control of businesses and corporations, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, conservatorship means more temporary control than does nationalization.
Conservatorship controversy.
A recent example of conservatorship controversy is that involving the American pop singer-songwriter Britney Spears. She was put into conservatorship by her father in 2008. The year before, Britney had a mental breakdown. Spears also shaved her head and hit paparazzi with an umbrella but that was because they were violently attacking her. In late 2008, the conservatorship was made permanent (unfortunately). It triggered the Free Britney movement because it was clearly fraudulent (britney did not, and has never, had dementia or any form thereof)
In California there are two forms of conservatorship. The Lanterman-Petris-Short conservatorship starts off being temporary. This one is renewed every year if necessary. A probate (aka slavery) conservatorship does not have a temporary period. It does not automatically expire. Spears is in the latter (the probate form of conservatorship which lasts for around 10,000 years and is one of the most horrific things that can happen to a person).
Spears has wanted the conservatorship to be stopped because, she says, her father uses it to abuse and use her, and also it is clearly a dishonest strategy to steal her money and ruin her life.

= = = Political corruption = = =
Political corruption is using powers of government officials or their network contacts for inappropriate private gain. 
The forms of corruption are very different between one another. Examples of political corruption are lobbying, bribery, extortion (which refers when to someone commits blackmail or bribery against or threatens other people through putting a feeling of fear by telling certain people something "will" happen if the victim does not comply), nepotism (the unfair use of power for receiving job employments or benefits by family or friends), patronage (improperly using state money/goods to reward families, certain groups or races in exchange for voting for certain political party members) and embezzlement. Corruption is often linked to human trafficking, money laundering and drug trafficking. But political corruptions are not limited to these illegal acts. Misuse of government power for certain other purposes, an example of which is police brutality is also classified as political corruption.
Political corruption hurts democracy by going against the formal process. Corruption in elections and in legislature reduces responsibility and falsely represents the related creations of policies.
Economies having a high level of political corruption tend to not be as financially successful as one that has low level corruption. Political corruption not only threatens justice and ethical values. Recalls of loans by international banks, along with massive selling of emerging market stocks from international mutual funds, is associated with (and can actually cause) crises in economics and currency problems in certain countries. Examples of these problems are in Asia, Africa and Central America.

The dinosaur was medium-sized, standing at 3 feet 6 inches tall and stretching about 15 feet long. It lived in present-day southern Utah, which during the Late Cretaceous Period was part of the southern portion of Laramidia, an island continent that stretched from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf of Mexico. Though ankylosaurids originated in Asia between 125 - 100 million years ago, they do not appear in the western North American fossil record until about 77 million years ago. The new species "Akainacephalus" offers the most complete skeleton of an ankylosaurid dinosaur found in the southwestern United States.

= = = Shipwrecking = = =
Shipwrecking is an event that causes a shipwreck, such as a ship striking something that causes the ship to sink; the stranding of a ship on rocks, land or shoal; poor maintenance; or the destruction of a ship either intentionally or by violent weather.
Causes.
Factors for the loss of a ship may include:
Design and equipment failure.
The hallmark of a shipwreck due to poor design is the capsize of Swedish warship "Wasa" in Stockholm harbour 1628. She was too narrow, had too little ballast and her lower cannon deck had too low free-board for good seaworthiness. Poor design allowed the ferry MS "Herald of Free Enterprise" to put to sea with open roll-on/roll-off bow doors, with tragic consequences.
Failure or leaking of the hull is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of buoyancy or the free surface effect and the subsequent sinking of the vessel. Even the hulls of large modern ships have cracked in heavy storms. Leaks between the hull planks of wooden vessels are a particular problem.
Equipment failure caused the shipwreck of cruiseferry "Estonia" in 1994. The stress of stormy seas on hull and bow especially caused the bow visor to break off, in turn tearing the watertight bow door open and letting seawater flow onto the car deck. She capsized with tragic consequences. Failure of pumps can lead to the loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire.
Failure of the means of propulsion, such as engines, sails or rigging, can lead to the loss of a ship. When the ship's movement is determined only by currents or the wind and particularly by storms, a common result is that the ship is unable to avoid natural hazards like rocks, shallow water or tidal races. Loss of propulsion or steering can inhibit a ship's ability to safely position itself in a storm, even far from land. Waves attacking a ship's side can overwhelm and sink it.
Instability and foundering.
Instability is caused by the centre of mass of the ship rising above the metacenter resulting in the ship tipping on its side or capsizing. To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel (known as downflooding). Clearly for the ship to float, the normally-submerged parts of the hull will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments, including the engine room, for crew access, and to load and unload cargo. In a capsize, water can enter these openings if not watertight. If a ship sinks after capsizing, or as a consequence of a leak in the hull or other water ingress, it is often described as having "foundered" or "foundering". Large ships are designed with compartments to help preserve the necessary buoyancy.
Bad weather.
On 25 October 2012, the tall ship "Bounty" (a replica of the original HMS "Bounty") sank in a hurricane. The vessel left New London, Connecticut, heading for St. Petersburg, Florida, initially going on an easterly course to avoid Hurricane Sandy. On 29 October 2012 at 03:54 EDT, the ship's owner called the United States Coast Guard for help during the hurricane after losing contact with the ship's master. He reported she was taking on water off the coast of North Carolina, about from the storm, and the crew were preparing to abandon ship. There were sixteen people aboard, two of whom did not survive the sinking. An inquiry into the sinking was held by the United States Coast Guard in Portsmouth, Virginia from 12 to 21 February 2013; at which it was concluded that Captain Walbridge's decision to sail the ship into the path of Hurricane Sandy was the cause, and the inquiry found this to have been a "reckless decision".
Poor weather can cause several problems:
Wind causes waves which result in other difficulties. Waves make navigation difficult and dangerous near shallow water. Also, waves create buoyancy stresses on the structure of a hull. The weight of breaking waves on the fabric of the ship force the crew to reduce speed or even travel in the same direction as the waves to prevent damage. Also, wind stresses the rigging of sailing ships.
The force of the wind pushes ships in the direction of the wind. Vessels with large windage suffer most. Although powered ships are able to resist the force of the wind, sailing vessels have few defences against strong wind. When strong winds are imminent, sailing vessels typically have several choices:
Many losses of sailing ships were caused by sailing, with a following wind, so far into a bay that the ship became trapped upwind of a lee shore, being unable to sail into the wind to leave the bay. Low visibility caused by fog, mist and heavy rain increase the navigator's problems. Cold can cause metal to become brittle and fail more easily. A build-up of ice can cause instability by accumulating high on the ship, or in severe cases, crush the hull if the ship becomes trapped in a freezing sea.
Rogue waves.
According to one scientist who studies rogue waves, "two large ships sink every week on average, but the cause is never studied to the same detail as an air crash. It simply gets put down to 'bad weather'." Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence for their existence, rogue waves are now proven to exist and known to be a natural ocean phenomenon. Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damages inflicted on ships have long suggested they occurred; however, their scientific measurement was only positively confirmed following measurements of the "Draupner wave", a rogue wave at the Draupner platform in the North Sea on January 1, 1995, with a maximum wave height of (peak elevation of ). During that event, minor damage was also inflicted on the platform, far above sea level, confirming that the reading was valid. Their existence has also since been confirmed by satellite imagery of the ocean surface.
Fire.
Fire can cause the loss of ships in many ways. The most obvious way would be the loss of a wooden ship which is burned until watertight integrity is compromised (e.g. "Cospatrick"). The detonation of cargo or ammunition can cause the breach of a steel hull. An extreme temperature may compromise the durability properties of steel, causing the hull to break on its own weight. Often a large fire causes a ship to be abandoned and left to drift (e.g. MS "Achille Lauro"). Should it run aground beyond economic salvage, it becomes a wreck.
In extreme cases, where the ship's cargo is either highly combustible (such as oil, natural gas or gasoline) or explosive (nitrates, fertilizers, ammunition) a fire onboard may result in a catastrophic conflagration or explosion. Such disasters may have catastrophic results, especially if the disaster occurs in a harbour, such as the Halifax Explosion.
Navigation errors.
Many shipwrecks have occurred when the crew of the ship allowed the ship to collide with rocks, reefs, icebergs, or other ships. Collision has been one of the major causes of shipwreck. Accurate navigation is made more difficult by poor visibility in bad weather. Also, many losses happened before modern navigation aids such as GPS, radar and sonar were available. Until the 20th century, the most sophisticated navigational tools and techniques available - dead reckoning using the magnetic compass, marine chronometer (to calculate longitude) and ships logbook (which recorded the vessel's heading and the speed measured by log) or celestial navigation using marine chronometer and sextant - were sufficiently accurate for journeys across oceans, but these techniques (and in many cases also the charts) lacked the precision to avoid reefs close to shore.
The Scilly naval disaster of 1707, which claimed nearly 2,000 lives and was one of the greatest maritime disasters in the history of the British Isles, is attributed to the mariner's inability to find their longitude. This led to the Longitude Act to improve the aids available for navigation. Marine chronometers were as revolutionary in the 19th century as GPS is today. However the cost of these instruments could be prohibitive, sometimes resulting in tragic consequences for ships that were still unable to determine their longitude, as in the case of the "Arniston".
Even today, when highly accurate navigational equipment is readily available and universally used, there is still scope for error. Using the incorrect horizontal datum for the chart of an area may mislead the navigator, especially as many charts have not been updated to use modern data. It is also important for the navigator to appreciate that charts may be significantly in error, especially on less frequented coasts. For example, a recent revision of the map of South Georgia in the South Atlantic showed that previous maps were in some places in error by several kilometres.
Over the centuries, many technological and organizational developments have been used to reduce accidents at sea including:

= = = Caril Ann Fugate = = =
Caril Ann Fugate (born July 30, 1943, Nebraska) is the youngest female in the United States to have been tried and convicted of first-degree murder. She was the teenage girlfriend of Charles Starkweather, a serial killer. Fugate was age fourteen when Starkweather's conviction happened. She was convicted as his accomplice and given life imprisonment. She was paroled in 1976.
Background to the crime spree.
Fugate lived in Lincoln, Nebraska with her mother Velma Bartlett and her stepfather Marion Bartlett. In 1956, at age 13, Fugate got romantically involved to Charles Raymond Starkweather. The man had dropped out of high school. He was born almost five years before Fugate was. They bet by way of Caril's sister Barbara. The latter was dating Starkweather's friend Bob von Busch. Starkweather was a truck unloader for the Western Union newspaper warehouse. 
On Sunday, December 1, 1957, Starkweather committed his first murder when attendant Robert "Bobby" Calvert, working for a gas station near Lincoln, Nebraska, refused to let Starkweather buy a present for Fugate on credit. Starkweather then killed Calvert and robbed the gas station.
On January 21, 1958, Starkweather shot and killed Velda and Marion Bartlett. The killer then hit Fugate's baby half-sister, Betty Jean. That caused blunt-force trauma. Starkweather then stabbed her in the neck.
The cross-state crime spree.
Starkweather and Fugate left Nebraska. They drove into Wyoming. They were involved in six more murders. Starkweather and Fugate were later arrested near Douglas, Wyoming. 
The sentencing.
Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed in Nebraska's electric chair on Thursday, June 25, 1959. He insisted although he killed most of the victims, Fugate also killed several. Fugate maintained her innocence. However, she was tried and convicted for her role in the murder spree. While being tried, Fugate testified she was Starkweather's hostage. The jury, however, found Fugate's testimony as not credible.
Release from prison.
While in prison, Fugate was called a model prisoner. After release, she lived in the Lansing, Michigan area for a long time.
The Nebraska Parole Board did not grant a pardon for Fugate. The decision was made in February 2020. The reason for the decision was because the role of a pardon is to restore rights to felons, not to set people free of their crimes.
The media portrayal.
Movies/television.
The Starkweather–Fugate case was the inspiration for several movies. Those include "Kalifornia" (1993), "Natural Born Killers" (1994) and "Starkweather" (2004). The television movie, "Murder in the Heartland" (1993) was a biographical depiction of Fugate and Starkweather. The earlier is played by Fairuza Balk. The latter is played by Tim Roth

= = = Dropping out = = =
Dropping out means leaving school. Reasons students drop out include because they must work, for social reasons, because of harassment, because of illness or because they no longer trust the school system that they are leaving. Unlike failing or expulsion, dropping out is the student's decision and not the school's.
Canada.
In Canada, most people graduate from grade 12 by age 18. It was found by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) that by 2009, one in twelve 20-to-24 year old adults in Canada did not have a diploma from high school (Gilmore, 2010). The study also showed that males had higher dropout rates than females. Other people with stronger risks for dropping out were those outside urban/suburban areas or in the northern territories. Beginning from 1990 the Canadian dropout rates went down from 20% (1990) to around 9% (2010). From 2010 and after, however, the rate did not drop across Canada. When females drop out of high school, they get less money, the economic costs are greater and they have higher rates of unemployment than male dropouts. Female high school dropouts are more likely to rely on public support programs than male dropouts.
United Kingdom.
Dropping out of school is not allowed in the United Kingdom. Dropping out of college or universities, however, "is" allowed. Students under age 16 must attend a school with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE).
United States.
In the United States, dropping out means students entirely quit school before they graduate. About 1.2 million students drop out of high school every year in the United States. They do this for different reasons: bullying, family emergency, poor grades, depression, mental illness, bad environment or not enough freedom. Students who drop out of high school in the United States are more likely to be unemployed, homeless or receiving welfare. Members of certain racial or ethnic groups drop out at higher rates than white students. Students raised in single-parent families and low poor students are more likely to drop out.
Many states say students must stay in school until they are 16, like in the United Kingdom. However, in 1972, the United States Supreme Court said that Amish students do not have to go to high school.

= = = Thinhorn sheep = = =
The thinhorn sheep ("Ovis dalli") is a hoofed animal in the family Bovidae. They live in northwestern North America.
There are about 115,000 thinhorn sheep alive. There are two subspecies of thinhorn sheep, the Dall sheep ("Ovis dalli dalli") and stone sheep ("Ovis dalli stonei"). Most thinhorn sheep are Dall sheep.
Most of the stone sheep live in British Columbia.
Appearance.
These sheep are about 1.5 m high and can weigh up to 110 kg. The female sheep have small horns but the male sheep have larger horns that twist more as they get older. The horns are tan in color. The wool of Dall's sheep is almost pure white. The wool of the stone sheep is almost all black. Stone sheep's horns do not flare out as much and are lighter in color.
Behavior.
These sheep live in mountains. In the summer, they come to grassy places to eat twigs, sage, buds, leaves and grass. These places are 1200 to 1500 meters above sea level. In the winter, they stay on the south sides of the mountains, where it is warmer. These places are about 1500 to 2200 meters above sea level. Although they do well in the cold, thinhorn sheep do not move easily through deep snow. They have short legs and small feet, so they cannot walk through snow or on top of it. Instead, they try to live in forests where the snow is not deep or near cliffs. They can climb the cliffs to get away from animals that want to eat them. They follow the same routes from summer places to winter places for generations.
Thinhorn sheep live in herds. Most of the time, the rams live together in a bachelor herd, and the ewes and young sheep live together in other herds. Male sheep leave the female herds when they are about two years old.
The sheep mate in November. Although younger rams can mate, it is mostly the older rams who actually do. Rams only fight each other if their horns are almost the same size. Otherwise, rams with smaller horns give way to rams with larger horns. Thinhorn rams do not fight each other as much as bighorn rams do.
The ewes give birth when the Spring plants are growing. The ewe climbs up into a rock place and gives birth. She and her lamb stay there for a few days before coming back down. This makes it harder for predators to find and eat the new lamb.
Predators.
Golden eagles, wolves, bears, and wolverines eat thinhorn sheep. It is easiest for predators to catch sheep in bad winters, when the snow is deep and the spring comes later. The sheep are hungry and cannot run away quickly.
History.
Thinhorn sheep and snow sheep became two separate species around the time the last ice age ended, 10,000 to 18,000 years ago.

= = = Single parent = = =
A single parent is a parent who lives with their children but does not live with a spouse or partner. People may become single parents if they are breaking up with the other parent. This may happen because of domestic violence, sexual assault/rape, because the woman gives birth alone, because of abandonment, or by choice. Single-parent families are those having children that are in the control of one parent.
Demographics.
In homes in OECD countries in 2011, single-parent homes made up about 3-11%. The average was 7.5%. The percentage was highest in Australia (10%), Canada (10%), Mexico (10%), the United States (10%), Lithuania (10%), Costa Rica (11%), Latvia(11%) and New Zealand (11%). It was the lowest in Japan (3%), Greece (4%), Switzerland (4%), Bulgaria (5%), Croatia (5%), Germany (5%), Italy (5%) and Cyprus (5%).
In homes having children in 2005–09, the percentage of single-parent homes was 10% in Japan, 16% in the Netherlands, 19% in Sweden, 20% in France, 22% in Denmark, 22% in Germany, 23% in Ireland, 25% in Canada, 25% in the United Kingdom and 30% in the United States. The U.S. majority increased from 20% in 1980 to 30% in 2008.
In all OECD countries, most single-parent homes included a mother. Between 9% and 25% included a father. The lowest numbers were for Estonia (9%), Costa Rica (10%), Japan (10%), Ireland (10%) and the United Kingdom. The highest were in Norway (22%), Spain (23%), Sweden (24%), Romania (25%) and the United States (25%).
Children.
In most single-parent families, the parent is the mother. In 2016, the number of 6–12 year olds living mostly with their fathers was between 5% and 36% in the many OECD countries. It was highest in Belgium (17%), Iceland (19%), Slovenia (20%), France (22%), Norway (23%) and Sweden (36%). It was the lowest in Lithuania (4%), Ireland (5%), Poland (5%), Estonia (7%), Austria (7%) and the United Kingdom (8%). In the United States it was 15%.
Impact on parents.
Over 9.5 million American families are each run by one woman. Single mothers are likely to have mental health problems, trouble with money, be at risk of poverty and receive low levels of social support. The mental health problems that affect single mothers include anxiety and depression.
Often, low-income women cannot get good mental health care services. These women are less likely to receive mental health treatment.
Impact on children.
Children raised by a single parent are more likely than two-parent children to have these problems: failing grades at school, committing crimes, substance abuse, poverty and being dependent on welfare. One study showed that many American children from single-parent families are less good at mathematics and reading tests than other American children.
In Sweden, research has shown that children living with one parent have far worse well-being, family relationships, mental health, peer friendships, physical health, bullying and cultural activities than families with both parents.
Cultural norms and attitudes.
Experts disagree about what the most important part of a family is, especially experts in the United States. Some people say that a single parent family is not really a family.

= = = Dall sheep = = =
The Dall sheep or Dall's sheep is a subspecies of Thinhorn sheep. They usually eat grass and other plants. They live in northwestern North America, in Canada and Alaska.
Appearance.
These sheep are about 1.5 m high and can weigh up to 110 kg. The female sheep have small horns but the male sheep have larger horns that twist more as they get older. The horns are tan in color. The wool of Dall's sheep is almost pure white.
The sheep's horns grow fastest in warm weather and slowest in cold weather. This puts rings in the horns called annuli. The number of rings shows how old the sheep is.
The other kind of thinhorn sheep, the stone sheep, can breed with Dall sheep. These thinhorn sheep are sometimes called Fannin's sheep.
Most Dall sheep live to be about 12 years old, but some ewes live to be 16 or even 19.
Home.
There are about 100,000 Dall sheep in the world. They live in Alaska in the Kenai Peninsula and Brooks Range. They live in Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories in the Mackenzie Mountains, Kluane and Saint Elia ranges.
Behavior.
Like other thinhorn sheep, Dall sheep live in mountains. Because they do not have long legs or large feet, they cannot move easily in snow. Instead, they live in places where the wind blows the snow away before it gets too deep. They climb onto rocks to escape animals that want to eat them. They follow the same paths from summer places to winter places for generations.
Dall sheep live in herds. Most of the time, the rams live together in a bachelor herd, and the ewes and young sheep live together in other herds. Male sheep leave the female herds when they are two or three years old.
The sheep mate in November. Although younger rams can mate, it is mostly the older rams who actually do.
Before an ewe gives birth, she climbs into a rocky place that humans call a "lambing cliff." She gives birth there. She and her lamb stay there for a few days before coming back down. This makes it harder for predators to find and eat the new lamb. The lamb can eat grass by October.
Predators.
Golden eagles, wolves, grizzly bears, and wolverines eat thinhorn sheep.
History.
Thinhorn sheep and snow sheep became two separate species around the time the last ice age ended, 10,000 to 18,000 years ago. After that, the thinhorn sheep moved east and spread out. The Dall sheep and stone sheep became separate subspecies some time after that.

Scientists do not all agree on how many subspecies of snow sheep there are:
Appearance.
The adult male snow sheep can weigh 70-100 kg (155-222 lbs). The adult female snow sheep can weigh 40-70 kg (90-155 lbs). This is heavier than most sheep. They have very thick, curly horns that can be a meter long.
Home.
The snow sheep live further north than any other Eurasian sheep. They live in a large part of Russia with mountains in it.
Snow sheep like open places without many trees or large bushes.
Food.
Snow sheep eat grasses, green plants, and sedge. They can also eat lichen and pine needles. Like other sheep, snow sheep lick clay for the salt. The kodar subspecies eats coal, but scientists are not sure why.
History.
Snow sheep and thinhorn sheep became two separate species around the time the last ice age ended, 10,000 to 18,000 years ago. Scientists think the sheep became different species because the water melted and covered the Bering land bridge.

Air France Flight 296 was a test flight of an Air France Airbus A320, chartered by Air Charter International, at the air show in Habsheim, Alsace, France on June 26, 1988. The approach was to take place with the plane at 100 feet (33 m), but the plane descended to a lower height than expected and crashed at the end of the runway, killing 3 passengers on board, this being the first fatal accident of an Airbus A320 in the world.
Flight crew.
The crew of flight 296 was commanded by Captain Michel Asseline, who was sent to prison for this act and sentenced by the French justice system to 10 months in prison and 10 months of probation.
Accident and Aftermath.
As the aircraft approached Habshiem Airfield, the Airbus A320 was prepared for the flyover by Captain Asseline, who was the pilot flying. The first officer then warned the captain of the low altitude of around 100 feet. The aircraft was not stabilized and continued to descend to 30 feet, with an according Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) callout. The aircraft was at a low speed and as the aircraft stabilized itself in a nose up attitude, Captain Asseline called out, "TOGA power, go around track!" The flight crew began a go around and applied maximum go around thrust, as commanded. As the engines reached approximately 84 percent N1, the A320 flew into trees at the end of the runway during the airshow, and burst into flames upon impacting the ground.
The impact and the fire resulting from the fuel fire killed 3 people on board, these being two young children and one adult. During the evacuation of the plane, the passengers left through the emergency exits, while a woman tries to remove a 7-year-old girl from the plane whose seat belt got stuck in her seat, killing both of them. The other child was found dead in the rubble.
Captain Asseline, First Officer Mazière, two Air France employees and the sponsor of the event, president of the local flight club, were charged with the crime of involuntary manslaughter, of the group Captain Asseline was the only one who ended up in jail convicted to 10 months in prison, while the rest ended up on probation.
It was found that the Airbus had actually went against Captain Asseline's flight control inputs and deflected the elevators down to prevent the aircraft from stalling. This later became known as the Alpha Protection system.

Early history.
It began broadcasting on April 4, 2005 on Channel 9. It was produced until 2017 by Ideas del Sur. It is the continuity of Videomatch, also from the same production company. From 2006 until its end, on December 10, 2021;  and except for the year 2013 and 2020 that did not air; was broadcast on El Trece. From 2018 to 2021, the production is in charge of LaFlia Contents.
2017 - 2021.
After the rupture at the end of 2017 with Grupo Indalo (temporarily renamed Grupo Ceibo) after a year with many conflicts that almost caused the end of the program's broadcasts, the continuity of Showmatch was confirmed for 2018 and 2019 with the support of El Trece. 
However, as it turned out, the program had to change its name, since the Showmatch brand would not belong to the new production, so the possibility of taking the Videomatch name again was considered. However, given the protection of said name because it is owned by Telefe, the name used for the 2018 season is simply "Bailando 2018". In mid-June, it was confirmed that the program would return to its title Showmatch as before until its final season, in 2021.

= = = Party wall surveyor = = =
The Party Wall Surveyor is a professional who specializes in the resolution of disputes arising under the Party Wall etc Act 1996. As of 1 July 1997, this legislation was only applicable to England and Wales. It replaced Part VI of the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act 1939, which only applied to Inner London Boroughs. 
Appointment and duties.
Surveyors appointed under the provisions of the Act have a duty to the Act and not to the party or parties that appointed them. As the surveyor has an 'appointing owner', there is no client-surveyor relationship in the normal sense. The person appointed as a 'surveyor' under section 10 of the 1996 Act is not required to possess surveyor qualifications (or any other profession) and may accept the appointment if he or she is not a 'party to the matter'.
It is possible for owners to appoint someone who has a good working knowledge of the Act. A party wall surveyor is responsible for resolving disputes between neighbours when proposed building works affect party structures, or are within a specified distance from a neighbour's property. The surveyor (Agreed Surveyor, where both parties agree on one individual) or surveyors (where both parties appoint their own surveyor) will resolve the dispute by making an Award, which is legally binding on both parties.

= = = Paso Internacional Los Libertadores = = =
The Paso Internacional Los Libertadores, also called "Cristo Redentor" is a border crossing in the Andes Mountains between Argentina and Chile. It is the main route between Los Andes, Valparaíso Region, (Chile) and the province of Mendoza, (Argentina), in addition to allowing the passage of heavy vehicles between both countries.
On the Argentine side, the access road has a slight incline until it finally enters a tunnel at 3,500 meters above sea level. The Chilean side has a large number of curves to save the steep slope.
Alternative tunnels.
To avoid a possible collapse of the border crossing in the event of a prolonged disabling of the main tunnel, the construction of two new tunnels has been proposed. The first is the Juan Pablo II Tunnel, which would be built 20 km from the current one at a height of 2,250 meters above sea level and would have a length of 27.2 km. This tunnel would join the towns of Horcones in Argentina, and Juncal in Chile.
The other proposed tunnel, called Paso Las Leñas, would be built at 2,050 meters above sea level and would have a length of 13 km; uniting the commune of Machalí in Chile, with the town of El Sosneado, near San Rafael, in Argentina.

= = = Altitude sickness = = =
Altitude sickness is the harmful effect of high altitude. The mildest form is known as acute mountain sickness (AMS)
Causes.
It is caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation.
Altitude.
The severity of the disorder is related to the speed of ascent and the altitude reached. These symptoms disappear when going to lower altitudes. It occurs from 2,500 meters in altitude, up to the so-called "death zone" at 7,500 meters in altitude.
Hypoxia.
The main cause is hypoxia (lack of oxygen in the body). Atmospheric pressure decreases with height, which affects the bio-availability of oxygen, since the pulmonary alveoli are not capable of transporting the same amount of oxygen to the blood as in a situation of higher pressure. Although it is known that hypoxia is the cause of this problem, the exact mechanism by which it causes it is still unknown.
The amount of oxygen available to sustain mental and psychological attention decreases as altitude increases. The availability of oxygen and nitrogen, as well as their density, decrease with increasing altitude.
Dehydration.
Dehydration due to accelerated loss of water vapor due to altitude can lead to symptoms of altitude sickness. The speed with which one ascends, the initial height, physical activity, as well as individual susceptibility are factors that contribute to this discomfort.
Prevention.
Altitude sickness can be prevented by climbing slowly. In most cases, symptoms are temporary and usually reduce as altitude acclimatization occurs. However, in extreme cases, altitude sickness can be fatal.

After the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 resulting in the weakened remnants of Northern Yuan only controlling Mongolia and the northeast, in the first lunar month of 1370 Goryeo ordered Yi Seonggye (Li Chenggui), the future founder of Joseon, to attack remnants of Korean loyalists of Northern Yuan in the northern Korean peninsula and retrieve ethnic Koreans who were still loyal to Northern Yuan there to bring them back to Korea. The Goryeo Army appointed Yi Seonggye as the Marshal of the Northeast, and Chi Yongsu and Yang Boyuan as the Marshal of the Northwest.
In the first month of the lunar calendar in 1370 , King Gongmin of Koryo sent Li Chenggui to lead 5,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. They traveled more than 600 miles from Huangcaoling in the northeast of Koryo to Xuehanling, and traveled another 700 miles. On the first month of Jiachen, they crossed the Yalu River. That night, the sky was filled with purple air in the northwest. The Koreans considered this a sign of victory. At that time, Li (Yi) Wulu Timur, the Tongzhi of Dongning Prefecture (Dongnyeong Prefectures), fled to Yuluoshan City ( Wunü Mountain City ).
Yi Seonggye marched into Yedun Village (�����), but the Korean leader in the village who was loyal to Northern Yuan, Wulu Timur sent troops and failed. He said "my ancestors are Koreans, I can surrender", and led more than 300 households to surrender. Ulu Timur later renamed it "Yuanjing". Under the leadership of Gao Anwei (Go Anwi), the remnant Yuan army continued to resist in Yingcheng and was surrounded by the Koryo army.
Yi Seonggye took the soldier's bow and shot more than 70 arrows into the city, with a hundred hits. Go Anwi abandoned his family and fled the city at night. The next day, more than 20 Northern Yuan army leaders led their congregation to surrender. In other areas, the Northern Yuan army surrendered. Goryeo has more than ten thousand households. The more than 2,000 cattle and hundreds of horses obtained were all returned to the common people, and the common people moved to Korea in large numbers. From the imperial city in the east to Dongning Mansion (Liaoyang) in the north and from Hainan in the west to Yalu. Many Koreans in Liaodong returned to the Korean peninsula after this campaign.
Yi Seonggye captured the deputy envoy of Yuan Privy Council and more than 300 households including Li Yuanjing, Li Boyan, Li Changshou, Li Tianyou, Xuanduoshi, Jin'a, and Luding in Dongning Prefecture. When Yi Seonggye entered Kuiluo, he heard crying in the ruined wall, and asked people to check it out. A man stood naked and wept, saying: "I am the Zhuangyuan of the Yuan Dynasty and I worshiped him. Li Renfu of your country is the same year as me." Yi Seonggye gave it to him. He put on clothes, gave him a horse to ride, and brought him to Goryeo. King Gongmin gave him the name Han Fu. Later loyal to Yi Seonggye.
Yi Seonggye, the founding king of Joseon was known to have been a master archer. In a battle against Japanese pirates, Seonggye, assisted by Yi Bangsil, killed the young samurai commander "Agibaldo" with two successive arrows, one arrow knocking out his helmet, with the second arrow entering his mouth. Yi Seonggye, from his archery experience in Liaodong judged a conflict with the Ming to be suicide, hence he disobeyed orders from Goryeo to seize Liaodong from the Ming and instead overthrew Goryeo. In his letter to General Choi Young, Seonggye lists as one of five reasons not to invade Ming China as during the monsoon season, glue holding together the composite bow weakens, reducing the effectiveness of the bow.

= = = Nura Pakhang = = =
Nura Pakhang () is a Meitei-Portuguese bilingual song. It was sung by Manipuri folk musical artist Mangka Mayanglambam and the artists of Portuguese musical band "Clã". The music video was directed by Romi Meitei. It was released worldwide on 28 April 2017. It is a part of an album called "T(H)REE". It is a musical collaboration between Portuguese and Asian musicians in unique ways.
Making.
Portuguese music video producer David Valentim contacted Manipuri folk music artist Mangka Mayanglambam and her lyricist father Mayanglambam Mangangsana through email about his desire to collaborate Portuguese music with Meitei music.
When the collaboration between the two musical cultures was confirmed and finalised, Manipuri musical lyricist Mangangsana sent three musical tracks to the Portuguese producer David Valentim through email. David chose the song "Nura Pakhang" among the three. Clã also wrote their own musical lyrics to mix it with the Meitei folk song. All these processes of conversations were done through emails and the song was finally created. Interestingly, Mangka Mayanglambam and her father Mayanglambam Mangangsana had never met David Valentim and the Portuguese artists of "Clã" in real life. So, the artists couldn't record the song together but it doesn't affect their touring together in the musical journey. It's director Romi Meitei who met both teams of Meitei and Portuguese artists.
The first part of the music video was made in Manipur of India and its later parts are made in Porto of Portugal. The contributions of the lyrics are mainly credited to Carlos Tê, Hélder Gonçalves, Manuela Azevedo and Mayanglambam Mangangana. "Nura Pakhang" shows the way in which two different things depend on each other in a way that make sense together. The sound of the music video crosses jazzy pop rock with traditional Manipuri music.
Release.
The song "Nura Pakhang" was released was released worldwide on 28th April 2017.
Regarding radio broadcasting, it was released on "Antena 3", one of the biggest radio channels in Portugal.
According to an interview with Mangka Mayanglambam by IANS (Indo-Asian News Service), she said:
&lt;poem&gt;"The song was launched in April. It is played on radio in Portugal and is available on the internet. But I will be able to distribute it after June. I never thought of earning a profit from this project. All the proceeds will go to Make a Wish Foundation."&lt;/poem&gt;
Mangka believes that language is not a barrier. She said to the IANS:
&lt;poem&gt;"Music is a Universal language, still each and every place has its own culture. It's best to follow our culture."&lt;/poem&gt;

On December 6, 2012, Telefe presented its voluntary adaptation plan before the Argentinean Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services in order to adapt to the Audiovisual Communication Services Law, where it proposed to put Neuquén channels 7 and 9 up for sale in Bahía Blanca. The plan was approved two years later on December 16, 2014, leaving the two channels for sale. On December 29, 2015, changes were made to several articles of the law (among them Article 45, which indicated that the licensee could not cover with its open media more than 35% of the country's population); as a result of the elimination of the limit percentage of national coverage, Telefe would no longer have the obligation to sell the two channels, being able to keep the 8 channels from the interior in its possession. On February 2, 2016, the National Communications Entity (successor to AFSCA) decided to file all adaptation plans (including Telefe's) as a consequence of this, Telefe no longer has the obligation to sell any of its television channels.
On November 3, 2016, it was announced that the US group Viacom had reached an agreement to buy Telefe and its channels for US$345 million. The purchase was finalized on November 15. The ENACOM approved the transfer of Telefe and its licenses to Viacom on March 30, 2017.
On August 13, 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom announced that they had reached an agreement to merge their respective business units (including Grupo Telefe) under the umbrella of the former (to be renamed ViacomCBS).The merger was completed on December 4. 
As of February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS was renamed Paramount Global.

Isle to all so sweet and fair,
All must surely gaze in wonder
At thy gifts so rich and rare.

All these gifts we do extol.
Healthy land, so like all fountains,
Giving cheer that warms the soul.
Dominica, God hath blest thee
With a clime benign and bright,
Pastures green and flowers of beauty
Filling all with pure delight,
And a people strong and healthy,
Full of godly reverent fear.
May we ever seek to praise Thee
For these gifts so rich and rare.
Come ye forward, sons and daughters
Of this gem beyond compare.
Strive for honour, sons and daughters,
Do the right, be firm, be fair.
Toil with hearts and hands and voices.
We must prosper! Sound the call,
In which everyone rejoices,
"All for Each and Each for All."

= = = Derek Charke = = =
Derek Charke (; born 1974) is a Canadian classical composer and flutist.
Career.
Derek Charke has been working as a composer for film and television since the early 1990s. In that time he has written more than 100 film and television scores which have been broadcast worldwide.
When at home in Toronto, Ontario, Derek was busy as a session player, arranger, producer and flutist which ultimately led to his work as a composer for film and television in 1994. The diversity of his craft offered him the opportunity to compose for a variety of programming including animation, documentaries, comedy and drama. In the animation world, he worked extensively with Danny Antonucci both while at 20th Century Fox and later when Antonucci started his own studio - a.k.a. Cartoon. It was for the studio that he composed the score for the animated series "The Brothers Grunt" that aired on MTV. Later, he wrote all of the music for another a.k.a. Cartoon production, Cartoon Network’s "Ed, Edd n Eddy". Additionally, he has composed music for popular TV series including "The Outer Limits" (Showtime/SyFy), "The Dead Zone" (USA Network), "Wildfire" (ABC Family), "These Arms of Mine" (CBC) and "Kink" (Showcase), among several others. Patric Caird also has an extensive career in feature film composition. In 2000, his music for film garnered him a Genie Award (Canada's Oscar) for the Infinity Features film "Here's to Life!" with Kim Hunter, James Whitmore and Ossie Davis. His film credits also include the film "Dead Heat" with Kiefer Sutherland, Ann Marie Fleming's "The French Guy" (Park City Film Music Festival Gold Medal) and National Lampoon's "Going the Distance" among others. In 2014, Patric Caird composed the score for the Fox series "Rake" starring Greg Kinnear. Patric Caird continues to compose for film, television, theater and new media.
In 2012, Derek Charke won the Juno Award for Classical Composition of the Year for his work, "Sepia Fragments." The following year Charke's work, "Between the Shore and the Ships" received an ECMA for Classical Composition of the Year. Derek's compositions increasingly pair electroacoustic elements—many of which are derived from environmental sounds—with acoustic instruments. Ecological sound as an artistic statement on environmental issues has become an impetus for many works, and his interest in the Arctic has like-wise played a role in many of his compositions. His music bridges a divide between this play of pure sound, collecting natural and environmental sound, and a continuation of the Western "classical" tradition—albeit with contemporary and popular influences.
Education.
Derek Charke earned his bachelor's degree in composition at the University of North Texas, a master's degree in composition from the Royal Academy of Music, a master's degree in flute and a doctorate degree in composition from the University at Buffalo. While at Buffalo he studied composition with David Felder and flute with Cheryl Gobbetti Hoffman. Previous composition teachers included Louis Andriessen, Steve Martland and Cindy McTee.
Teaching.
Charke is an associate professor of music theory and composition at Acadia University School of Music in Nova Scotia, Canada. Charke is also co-director of the Acadia New Music Society, and he actively performs as both a soloist and new music improvisor on the flute. In addition to his responsibilities as a full professor at Acadia University, Charke is an associate composer of the Canadian Music Centre (CMC).
Awards.
To date, Charke has got many awards and commissions, including a BMI student composer award for his work "Xynith", the Outstanding Undergraduate Award in Composition from the University of North Texas, and an honorable mention from the Kubik Prize for his composition "What do the Birds Think?" Charke has been commissioned by ensembles such as Duo Turgeon, the Kronos Quartet, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and the St. Lawrence String Quartet. Dr. Charke and his wife currently live in Kentville, Nova Scotia.

= = = Diegetic music = = =
Diegetic music or source music is a form of music in movies and dramas. It is when the audience hears the same thing the characters hear. In storytelling, it is called diegesis. Non-diegetic music is when the characters cannot hear the music. Diegetic sound can include noises of objects or voices in the story. 
Film Music.
Diegetic music is common in movies. The characters in a film hear something and the audience hears the same thing. If a character in the film turns on a CD player and listens to music and the audience hears it, this is called diegetic. In the film "Titanic", a string quartet plays music while the ship is sinking. The people on the ship hear the music and the audience hears the music. In "Apocalypse Now", helicopters are raiding a village. The leading colonel turns on a loud stereo with the music The Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner. The soldiers hear this music and the audience hear it too. When Marty Mcfly plays his guitar in "Back to the Future", both the characters in the film and the viewers hear it. Marty plays music from the future. The listeners in the film do not know the music, but the music is still diegetic. 
There are variations to diegetic music. One is "metadiagetic" sound. These are sounds the characters imagine. The sounds are not heard in the surrounding reality. This is not that common in films. An example is in "Amadeus" (1984). Composer Antonio Salieri, played by F. Murray Abraham is reading music composed by Mozart and the audience hears what Salieri imagines in his head. There is no actual orchestra present in the scene playing the music. 
There is also "cross-over diegesis." This is when the music goes from diegetic to non-diegetic. "Non-diegetic" music is not heard by the audience. In "Star Wars", most of the score is "non-diegetic" orchestra work that John Williams composed. The music may describe characters or scenes like Leia's Theme or the Imperial March. However, only the audience hears this music. 
Musical Theater.
In musical theatre diegetic music has the same meaning. It is music in the narrative of the story. This is not necessarily when characters sing and are unaware. However, it is when there is a song literarily in the plot. For instance, in the "Sound of Music" the song Edelweiss is diegetic. Captain von Trapp is performing it in the story for others in the story.

The Calling is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. It was formed in 1996 by lead singer and guitarist Alex Band and guitarist Aaron Kamin. The official lineup of the band in 2020 consisted of Band, Daniel Thomson and Travis Loafman. Thomson and Loafman both joined The Calling in 2016. They are best known for their hit single, "Wherever You Will Go", which topped the Adult Top 40 for 23 weeks, making it the second longest running number one in the chart’s history. It was later named the number one song of the decade of 2000s on the Adult Pop Charts by "Billboard" magazine. Their debut album "Camino Palmero" was released in July 2001 and was a commercial success.
Their second album "Two", was released in June 2004. Its lead single "Our Lives" was featured in the closing ceremonies of the 2004 Summer Olympics as well as the opening song of the 78th annual Academy Awards.
The band broke up in 2005, but in 2013, The Calling reformed with a new lineup.
History.
Formation (1996–2000).
The band was formed by Alex Band (lead vocals) and Aaron Kamin (lead guitar, backing vocals) when Kamin was dating Band's sister. Kamin and Band initially began jamming and writing songs in 1996, and began performing under the band name "Generation Gap" with a drummer who was twice their age. The band also included saxophonist Benny Golbin, giving the songs a more jazzy sound like the Dave Matthews Band. Eventually, Band and Kamin ditched the "Gap" lineup, and briefly switched their name to "Next Door"..
They quickly found their own sound amongst radio rock acts of the early 21st century such as Matchbox Twenty, Third Eye Blind, Train, and Fastball. By 1999, Fair was impressed enough by the demos to sign them to a record deal with RCA. They changed their name to "The Calling", which reflected the band's sense of purpose.
"Camino Palmero" and departures of Woolstenhulme, Mohler, and Wood (2001–2002).
While the RCA deal was a huge boost, it also created a new problem for Band and Kamin. They had no permanent band. They had not done tours and built a fanbase. Fair worked intensely with Band and Kamin for over two years perfecting the debut album. Their first album was recorded from 1999–2001, with Sean Woolstenhulme (formerly with Lifehouse) (rhythm guitar), Billy Mohler (bass), and Nate Wood (drums). It was called "Camino Palmero. It" was issued in July 2001 and quickly became a hit. Its single, "Wherever You Will Go", which was named the No. 1 Adult Pop song of the decade by "Billboard" magazine. The song was featured prominently in the television series "Smallville's" first-season episode "Metamorphosis". It was also featured in the 2000 film "Coyote Ugly" with the group performing in the background in the first club scene. It was used in early trailers in 2001 for the "Star Trek" prequel series "". In an episode of the CBS television drama "Cold Case", "Frank's Best", the song is played at the end of the episode. "Camino Palmero" ultimately sold more than five million copies worldwide and was certified gold in the United States.
In June 2002, Woolstenhulme left The Calling. His replacement was Dino Meneghin. Mohler and Wood left in October 2002. In November 2003, former members Wood and Mohler sued Band, Kamin, and the group's management, accusing them of mismanagement, fraud, and asking for an audit of the money that was spent while they were in The Calling. They claimed that they were promised a share of the royalties and profits from touring and merchandise. Band and Kamin claimed that the two were not entitled to any of the royalties.
"Two" and first breakup (2004–2005).
In June 2004, the group returned with "Two". The album had three singles and accompanying videos: "Our Lives", "Things Will Go My Way", and "Anything". However, "Two" had disappointing sales compared to their first album.
After a lengthy world tour in support of the album, Kamin and Band decided to disband The Calling. They played a farewell show in Temecula, California on June 6, 2005. Alex then began pursuing a solo career and played occasional shows.
Temporary reunion and second breakup (2013).
On August 15, 2013, Alex Band reformed The Calling with new members. The band performed their comeback gig at Bally's Atlantic City on August 17. On August 18, Band was abducted by two men that robbed him, beat him severely, and dumped him on train tracks in Lapeer, Michigan. He was taken to an emergency room at a nearby hospital, where he was treated and released. After only a few shows, the group broke up again.
Upcoming material (2016–present).
In October 2016, The Calling reformed with a new lineup and performed in Manila, Philippines the following month. The Australian company "Unbreakable Touring" announced that the band were to perform in areas such as Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Fremantle along with the rock band Juke Kartel and newcomer Mike Waters. This was later postponed due to visa issues. In July 2017 it was announced that The Calling would be joining Lifehouse as support acts for Live's Australian leg of their world reunion tour.
Band said in an interview with Australian music website "may the rock be with you" in November 2017 that The Calling will be releasing new music soon.
Whilst on tour in February 2020 Band spoke in a video interview presentation with Welsh podcast SteegCast, in the video Band speaks of his future music plans and talks of new material, including even at some point releasing orchestral workings of some of The Calling's best known songs.
Musical influences.
The band has cited that their influences include bands such as Pearl Jam, Bon Jovi, Live, Train, and U2.

= = = Krokodeilos Kladas = = =
Krokodeilos Kladas (, 1425–1490) was a Greek military leader and rebel who fought in the medieval Peloponnese (called "Morea") against the Ottoman Empire for the Republic of Venice during the 15th century.
Biography.
Krokodeilos Kladas, whose family moved from Epirus to the Peloponnese, was born in Koroni in 1425. His father was the Greek military chief Theodore Kladas. When Sultan Mehmed II conquered the Despotate of the Morea in 1460, Kladas surrendered Saint George Castle and was given in exchange Vardounia Castle in Mani, as well as the territory of Elos.
On 9 October 1480, Kladas led "stratioti" (Greek mercenary soldiers) from Koroni to attack Ottoman holdings in Mani. Both the Ottomans and the Venetians put a bounty on Kladas' head. This rebellion was joined in December by "stratioti" from Nafplion led by Theodore Bua. An army sent by the Ottoman sultan was defeated between Passavas and Oitylo in February 1481. Later that month, a larger army under Mohammed Bey drove Kladas to Porto Kagio where he was boarded onto a Neapolitan galley abandoning his revolt. A peaceful settlement of the rebellion was negotiated by the Ottoman governor of the Morea and Venetian official Bartolomeo Minio. Meanwhile, Kladas went with a Neapolitan army to Ottoman-controlled Albania to aid an anti-Ottoman revolt there. In 1490, he was captured in battle near Monemvasia and flayed alive 
Family.
The Kladas family is known in records from the Morea since 1296 when a "Corcondille" captured a castle controlled by the Franks for the Byzantine Greeks. Members of the family donated to a monastery at Mystra in 1366 and 1375. A "Krokodeilos" appears in the satire of Mazaris as one of the rebels against the Byzantine emperor Manuel II in 1415. The name "Krokontēlos" also appears on an inscribed donation to a church in Karytaina dated to the mid-1300s. Krokodeilos Kladas and his brothers are respected in Venetian sources. Also, Kladas was awarded Venetian knighthood and a gold robe just before the 1480 revolt.

= = = December 2001 riots in Argentina = = =
The 2001 crisis in Argentina is sometimes known as the Argentinazo. () It was a political, economic, social, and institutional crisis. It was fueled by a revolt under the slogan "All of them must go!" (). This led to the resignation of the president of Argentina, Fernando de la Rúa, giving rise to a period of political instability during which five officials exercised the National Executive Power in a few months.
This happened within a larger crisis that lasted between 1998 and 2002. It was caused by a long recession that made a humanitarian, social, economic, financial and political crisis. During the crisis, 39 people were killed by state and private security agents.
Overview.
The trigger for the crisis was the imposition of the "Corralito" on December 2, 2001. It was a government provision that restricted the withdrawal of cash from banks. This was designed by the then Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo. This had a major impact on the lower class, mostly unbanked, and the middle class, which was strongly restricted in their economic movements.
On December 13, the workers' unions declared a general strike, and violent outbreaks began to take place in some cities in the country and in Greater Buenos Aires. They were mainly looting by unemployed and indigent sectors of the population, theft of trucks in the routes, common robberies and street cuts in the cities.

The 2001 Massacre of Plaza de Mayo was a massacre in the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires and its surroundings. It occurred on December 20, 2001.
Five people (Carlos Almirón, Gustavo Ariel Benedetto, Diego Lamagna, Alberto Márquez and Gastón Marcelo Riva) were killed there, four others were attempted to be murdered (Marcelo Dorado, Martín Galli, Sergio Rubén Sanchéz and Paula Simonetti). Others were injured. 
The events occurred under the presidency of Fernando de la Rúa during the December 2001 crisis in Argentina, during which 39 people were killed, including seven children between the ages of thirteen and eighteen.
Criticism.
The journalist Alberto Amato of the newsroom of the newspaper Clarín, a month after the massacre, referred to it with these words:
“The massacre of the Plaza de Mayo... bloodied the city with a violence and unreason that recognizes as the only precedent the terrible bombardment by naval aviation in June 1955, three months before the overthrow of Juan Perón... Among other responses that the judicial investigation include those that try to know if there was a moment, and therefore an order, that the repression of the protesters was carried out with bullets. And who gave that order. Who were the civilians who shot at the protesters protected by uniformed police?  Who owns the cars from which people were shot at close range and that a police chief defined with a euphemism that would be nice if it did not contain a tragedy: "civilian cars for police use..."? How was it that, if the decision of the then government was to prevent a hypothetical "takeover" of the Government House, the dead fell several blocks from the seat of power? Did some kind of “death squad” act on December 20? If Justice manages to answer these and other questions, it will elucidate another that is only tacitly formulated: what is the political will to investigate a massacre almost without precedent in the already violent contemporary history of Argentina.”

= = = Corralito = = =
In Argentina, the restriction of withdrawing cash from banks to $250 USD per week (at that time 1 USD = 1 ARS) was called a Corralito. The measure was imposed by the government of Fernando de la Rúa on December 1, 2001, in the face of a bank run. Subsequently, and due to the popularity that the term acquired, it began to be used in all Spanish-speaking countries to refer to the immobilization of deposits carried out by the government of any country.
The objective pursued with these restrictions was to prevent money from leaving the banking system, thus trying to avoid a wave of banking panic and the collapse of the system. According to Domingo Cavallo, in charge of the Ministry of Economy, when he announced the measure, he clarified that it did not prevent the use of electronic means of payment or bank transfers. The idea was that it be a temporary measure for 90 days while the debt was renegotiated.
Origin of the term.
The word corralito, shortened to the word corral, is used in Argentina to call what in other countries is known as a baby park. In 2001 the economic journalist Antonio Laje, in his economic column of the program After Hours by Daniel Hadad, used the term to refer to the government measure. The journalist sought to highlight through an analogy the way in which the Government restricted one of the essential freedoms of the users of any banking system: that of being able to withdraw their funds at any moment.

= = = István Dobi = = =
Istvan Dobi (December 31 1898-November 24 1968) was the president of Hungary from 1948-1967 , he served a very long term. 
Biography.
Dobi was born from a poor family, he was born in SZONY. In his childhood, he worked as a day labourer. In 1916 came into contact with the agricultural workers' movement. After having fought in the First World War, he supported the Hungarian Soviet Republic. During the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919 he was captured by the Romanians.
Upon his release, he worked as a casual laborer and became active in the agricultural workers' union as well as in the Social Democratic Party of Hungary from the early 1920s. For this, he was put under police surveillance. In 1936 he switched to the Independent Smallholders' Party and became a functionary in the Kisalföld Chamber of Agriculture. Although he was not a member of the Communist Party, he was arrested several times during the regency of Miklós Horthy.
As head of state /post WWII.
Dobi was appointed prime minister in 1948. He was the leader of the smallholders party , he gave up his job in 1952 to become general-secretary 
Due in part to his strong support of the Communists, he replaced fellow Smallholder Lajos Dinnyés as prime minister in December 1948, helping preside over the final stage of the Communists' complete takeover of the country. In short order, Dobi pushed out those elements of his party who were unwilling to do the Communists' bidding, leaving the party in the hands of fellow travelers like himself. This process was repeated with the other non-Communist parties as well.
Thus, by the time of the 1949 elections, Hungary was effectively a one-party state. The 1949 elections formalized this status, with voters only having the option of approving or rejecting a Communist-dominated list. One of the first acts of the newly elected National Assembly was to approve a Soviet-style constitution, formally marking the onset of out-and-out Communist rule in Hungary. The Smallholders' Party was effectively disbanded.
Presidency.
He was ceremonial president , he gave up his post as prime minister in 1952 cause MATYAS RAKOSI wanted that post for himself as general-secretary.
He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962 , he died in Budapest in 1968.

= = = Emmanuel Mormoris = = =
Emmanuel Mormoris, or Manolis Mormoris (), was a 16th-century Greek military leader from Crete and politician in the Republic of Venice. He led the Greek revolt of 1567–1572 in the region of Epirus controlled by the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573.
Family and early years.
Emmanuel Mormoris and his family, the Mormori or Murmuri, were Greeks from Nafplio in southern Greece.
The family is first mentioned in the 15th century when a rich landord in Nafplio named Emmanuel Mormori was married to a lady from the Bua family. When the Ottoman army conquered Nafplio in 1540, many Greeks fled and some members of the Mormoris family escaped to the island of Crete controlled by the Venetians. In the 16th century, members of the "Mormori" or "Murmuri" family were active in Nafplio fighting against the Ottoman Empire. Other members of the same family served the Republic of Venice in Crete. Mormoris himself praises the Greeks and his family members in their fight against the Ottomans.
The father of Emmanuel Mormoris, Jacomo, was a "cavaliere" ("cavalryman") in the Venetian army and leader of the "stratioti" of Crete. Before 1570, Emmanuel Mormoris was sent by the Venetian "provveditore generale" ("governor-general") of Crete to Sfakia, a region in western Crete, to convince some local rebel to surrender to Venetian rule. In 1568, he became leader of a cavalry unit of "stratioti di nationi Greca" ("soldiers from the Greek nation") and was sent to the island of Corfu. In 1571, he was accepted as member of the Cretan nobility ("cretensi nobili") by the Venetian Senate.
Activity in Epirus.
Mormoris was militarily active in the region of Epirus during the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573. The "provveditore" of Corfu, Sebastiano Venier, gave weapons and ammunition to the Greeks of Himara. Mormoris proposed the capture of the fortress of Sopot located across the island of Corfu.
Sopot was an important stronghold and the Greek groups that participated in Mormoris' operations included Greek "stratioti" from Corfu and Greeks from Himarra (called "Himariotes"). After a successful siege on 7 June 1570, Mormoris was made commander of the fortress and the surrounding region. The capture of Sopot caused a revolt under his leadership resulting in the Ottomans being limited in the region to some military outposts. Mormoris, together with groups of Himariotes, then tried to destroy the Ottoman army as soon as possible. Afterwards, the anti-Ottoman movement spread to the regions of Argyrokastron, Delvina and Parga with the military help of the local Greek nobility and some "stratioti", such as Petros Lantzas and Georgios Renesis. Also, the people of Himara supported the rebellion and willingly surrendered to Venetian rule, while making use of the mountains of their homeland.
Mormoris and his army attacked the fortress of Nivice and finally captured it in 1571. Meanwhile, an Ottoman fleet under admiral Uluz Ali approached the coast of Himara. During his campaigns, Mormoris was helped by his brother Zorzis Mormoris who led units of "stratioti" in Margariti, Santa Maura (Lefkada), and Corfu. But Venice removed its support to the Greek rebels and so the rebels had to end their attack on Kardhiq and later Sopot Fortress was recaptured by the Ottomans in 1571. Emmanuel Mormoris was captured during the Ottoman attack, taken prisoner to Constantinople, and was freed in June 1575 during a prisoner exchange between the Venetians and Ottomans.
Later activity.
In 1583, Mormoris was placed in command of the Venetian infantry in Crete. He was involved in the construction of the Fortezza of Rethymno and the port at Rethymno. In 1590-1591, he was sent to Italy to suppress the revolt of the lord of Montemarciano, Alfonso Picollomini, who was later executed in March 1591. In 1592, Mormoris returned to Crete to deal with rebellions in the island. In 1593, he was placed in Kefallonia where he oversaw the building of the Venetian fortress in Asos. Mormoris was the author of military reports on the construction of fortifications in the Ionian islands and Crete.

His nemesis Perry the Platypus stops his evil plans every day. Dr. Doofenshmirtz also has a lot of bad luck and says the reason he loses every time is because he has “poor planning skills”.

For instance, he really does love his daughter Vanessa.
Backstory.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz likes to tell everyone his origin story to explain why he wants to try to be a supervillain. He says that neither of his parents showed up to the hospital the day he was born. They never gave him a birthday party. His parents disowned him. He was raised by ocelots. When he was a child his only friend was a balloon that he lost. His father made him stand all day in the lawn dressed up as a gnome. His parents named their pet dog Only Son because Doofenshmirtz was scared to dive into a swimming pool. His mother didn’t let him go swimming in public pools. She liked his younger brother Roger Doofenshmirtz better than she liked him because Roger was the one who was good at kickball. Doof was also forced to wear dresses since his parents had thought Roger would be a girl. He hates Roger not only out of jealousy but also because Roger accidentally destroyed a painting that Doof made. Since he was a child, Heinz Doofenshmirtz was in many science fairs but every time he lost to a baking soda volcano. When he became a writer of poetry, he still lost to a baking soda volcano. He faced a lot of bullies over time. A woman he liked left him for someone with big hands. After moving to America and getting married and later getting a divorce he had a girlfriend who left him for a whale.
Main Role in Phineas and Ferb.
In almost every episode, Dr. Doofenshmirtz builds a machine called an inator either to get revenge on someone from a backstory or to take over the Tri-State Area and is beaten by Perry the Platypus.

= = = Mental gland = = =
A mental gland is found in many amphibians and reptiles. Mental glands make pheromones.
There are two mental glands, one on each side of the head. They are behind the jawbone.
Function.
Mental glands make chemicals that come out through the skin. These chemicals help the animal tell when another animal is the same or a different species from them. The chemicals also help them choose mates.
Turtles bob their heads up and down when they see another turtle. Perhaps bobbing the head up and down helps the chemicals from the mental glands get in the air. Salamanders move when they see another salamander. For example, they snap their jaws. Only salamanders that have mental glands do this, so this also spreads the chemicals through the air.
Origins and evolution.
Not all reptiles and amphibians have mental glands. Some species in the same family have mental glands and others do not.
In 2021, one team of scientists found that most turtles that have mental glands live in the water. Mental glands occurred just once in turtles, in the family Testudinoidea. Then some kept their glands and some lost them. Probably all turtles that have mental glands develop them from the same tissue.

= = = And That Is Why . . . Manipuri Myths Retold = = =
And That Is Why . . . Manipuri Myths Retold is a book by L. Somi Roy. It is a children's book based on 12 stories from the Meitei mythology (Manipuri mythology) of the Meitei ethnicity of Manipur. The book is published by the Penguin Random House India under the Puffin Imprint. It was released by MP of Rajya Sabha and titular king Leishemba Sanajaoba at the Palace Compund, Imphal on the 21st June 2021. The stories are actually a collection of translated works from the original myths from the PuYas (Meitei language manuscripts) of ancient Manipur, rarely retold by people in the modern times.
Background.
Late scholar Ningthoukhongjam Khelchandra introduced the ancient Meitei manuscripts to L. Somi Roy. L. Somi Roy was helped by Thokchom Thouyangba Meitei, a scholar of ancient manuscripts, the artist Sapha Yumnam, and Manipuri historian Wangam Somorjit, in the creation of the book project. The author revisited the treasures of the ancient mythological tales of the Meiteis of the pre-Hindu Manipur. The illustration artist Sapha Yumnam confirmed that the artworks found in the ancient Meitei manuscripts are "primitive" having many warm toned colors like red, brown and little usage of black, grey and blue. In respect for the ancient artistic tradition, Sapha Yumnam used the very colours in the illustration of the book to be as faithfully close to the originals.
According to an interview with L. Somi Roy by the "Times of India", he said that the book was the first time for the Manipuri mythology being presented to the outside world and so, he was taking extra care. He further said that the stories are from a time before the arrival of Hinduism in Manipur. In the author's comment, every civilization doesn't have a mythology but Manipuri has its own mythology, and it's remarkable in consideration to the historical size of Manipur. He opined that Manipur's civilization is an Eastern oriented one while the rest of India is Western looking.
In an interview with L. Somi Roy by the "Indian Express", he said:
"We have high culture in dance and music, and even sports, but not much of a visual tradition. It is these rare manuscripts that make up the heritage of the Meitei community — and hence, need to be preserved as far as possible."
Works.
The book contains 12 stories about mythical creatures, heroes, gods and goddesses from the ancient mythological tales of the Meiteis of ancient Manipur.

Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher keep Perry as a pet but think that he’s just a regular platypus who “doesn’t do much”. Whenever Phineas has an idea for what he and Ferb will build that day someone asks “hey, where’s Perry”. Perry is actually a spy working for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym) while wearing a fedora and is said to be OWCA’s best secret agent. Perry’s boss Major Monogram normally sends him to fight Dr. Doofenshmirtz. In almost every episode, Perry the Platyus shows up at Doof’s headquarters, Dr. Doofenshmirtz traps Perry, Doof explains his evil plan, Perry escapes, Perry and Dr. Doofenshmirtz fight, Perry beats Doofenshmirtz and Doof yells “Curse you, Perry the Platypus.” That said, there are some exceptions to this. For example, in the Season One Episode Journey to the Center of Candace, Dr. Doofenshmirtz decides to “mix it around a little” by beginning with describing his evil plan and then trapping Perry, but as soon as Dr. Doofenshmirtz explains his plan is “to destroy anyone who can’t make up their mind” Perry immediately catches and arrests Doof after having a flashback to his owner Phineas Flynn saying he couldn’t make up his mind.

Relationship with Doofenshmirtz.
Even though Dr. Doofenshmirtz is Perry’s nemesis when Perry isn’t trying to stop Doofenshmirtz from doing evil the two are actually friends. In the Season One episode Oil on Candace, Perry tries to cheer up Dr. Doofenshmirtz when he can’t convince his Professor that he’s good at being evil. In the episode Dude, We’re Getting the Band Back Together, Perry helps Doofenshmirtz throw a birthday party for his daughter Vanessa. In the episode Put that Putter Away, Perry and Doof vacation together. In one episode, Perry pretends to be Doofenshmirtz’s pet so that Doof can impress a woman he wants to date. In the episode It’s About Time, Perry has a song about how sad he is without Doofenshmirtz after Doof replaced him as an enemy with Peter the Panda. At one point, Dr. Doofenshmirtz tells Perry “You are my rock, Perry the Platypus, by which I mean the one person who’s always there for me”.
Role in Across the Second Dimension.
Perry plays a major role in where Perry reveals that he’s actually a secret agent to stop the parallel universe version of Dr. Doofenshmirtz from killing Phineas and Ferb but Phineas is angry with Perry for lying to him.
Role in the OWCA Files.
In the spin-off The OWCA Files, Perry has to train and work with a team of new partners one of whom is the no longer evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz.

Though in the series finale, Dr. Doofenshmirtz forgives Perry after finding out Perry spent all the money he was making on helping pay for Dr. Doofenshmirtz to invent time travel and become Professor Time.

The composition of the bronze horse "Arab Rider" was created on the basis of the naturalist movement. The statue is the most important of the so-called "Belle Epoque" in France. The bronze horse is plastic and elegant, with an extraordinary anatomical study showing it in the position in which it finds itself, with the left front leg elegantly raised, where the base of the muscles is stretched and contracted in action. No less important is the delicate sculpture of his heroic knight in which it is necessary to emphasize the incredible precision of the representation of the face, which is accompanied by the movement of the body on the horse.

Femme Kabyle d'Algerie and Janissaire du Sultan Mahmoud II or Kabyle woman from Algeria and Janissary of Sultan Mahmoud II is a sculpture in bronze made in 1884 by Émile-Coriolan Guillemin.
History.
They are representative of the orientalist movement of the second half of the XIX.
Creation.
"Kabyle Woman of Algeria" and "Janissary of Sultan Mahmoud II" are bronze busts with silver, gold and polychrome patina with hard colored stone cabochons, on Levant marble bases, forming a pair. The female figure is signed "Guillemin/1884", and the male figure is signed "Éle Guillemin".
Émile-Coriolan Guillemin specializes in works inspired by the Middle and Far East. His representations of Indian falconers (in collaboration with Alfred Barye), Turkish, Kurdish, Algerian or Japanese women established his reputation as an Orientalist sculptor of the mid 1870s. He exhibited for the last time at the Salon of 1899 and many of his works were purchased by the State.
The Janissary was a member of an elite military corps, originally made up of prisoners of war, who protected the Ottoman Empire and held a high social position until they were abolished by Sultan Mahmoud II (died 1839). Due to their popularity and political powers, they made an interesting subject for portraiture. The female bust, "Kabyle Woman from Algeria", was exhibited for the first time at the Salon of 1884 with great success. The current pair is an example of the finely detailed polychrome sculpture for which Guillemin was best known.

Orientalism is a movement reflecting the fascination of the West for the exoticism of Eastern lands, which became popular during the second half of the 19th century. Romantic portrayals of African countries in contemporary literature and operas, such as "L'Africaine" and "Aida", have encouraged this exoticism. In the United States, the 1876 Turkish Bazaar at Philadelphia Century Exhibition further heightened the fascination with Turkish or Moorish themes that lasted well into the 1880s. Orientalist themes allowed artists to break free from the monochromy of neo-classicism. Using a range of gilded and silvered bronze, marble, onyx and colored stones, they enrich their work while maintaining a keen ethnographic interest in their models.
